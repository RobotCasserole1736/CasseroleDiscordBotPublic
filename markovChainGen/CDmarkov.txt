We are in the Chespeake Regional thing, I think.



This thread is being close because it's 2004.  Check this thread for 2004 Web entries [http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23571](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23571)


what do you do if the balls get dropped before you are deployed?

I'm not trying to suggest that any robot capable of driving in a straight line during autonymous mode could render your primary function moot, just that... oh wait, that is what I'm suggesting.

uber fubar

-N~O~

p.s. My last name is Olds as well. I'm sure you find this bit of minutia highly entertaining.  And this post was done by a teammate of mine too lazy to setup a login, not me, i just wanted to say hi.




To be honest I do not for see balls ropping before we go under the chute, I mean if we go to ours it will take what 1 second?
P.S. You mean there are other Olds' out there?




Impressive Funnelbot! I have to say great jorb. &lt;=== that was intentional

It would be nice to see a video on how your robot delivers those balls into the Ball Coral. Again, just amazing!




Pictures and videos will be posted within a week.



nobody has asked the scary question yet?

are you going to use your superbot for good or evil???

in other words, which side are you going to park that thing under?

your side or your opponents side?




We will have to see, however the most logical thing would be to park it under our own.  However we can do both.



wow! these guys are nice enough to show a photo and video of their machine weeks before the first regional

and now you are ganging up online to devise strategies against them?

Hows this for a strategy - they have a super way to capture their 18 balls when they drop - I dont see any thing to grab the 2X ball, and I dont see anything to do a chinup with

so if you want to beat them, build a machine that can outscore them - they WILL be master of the small balls on their side of the field, but there are two other ways to increase your own score.

besides, at the end of the match, if they loose, your score will be = their score, so devising a way to prevent them from scoring is a loosing strategy for you in the long run.

BTW - team 93 - nicely done!




Thanks Ken, your comment kinda reminded me of Andy's soap box [post](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=223202#post223202)  (which btw I had to help the old man get down from).  Also thanks for putting positive imput.



New Apple Corps is at it again. Great job, guys! This is an awesome design.

Andy B.




Thanks Andy, can't wait to see your bot as well!



The $64,000 question: Does it have to be dead on to catch all the balls? Or can it be off a foot or more on either side and still catch them all? You never know with autonomous mode.

Also, good bot. Hope to see you at Champs. I think you and Spark 5 would be good partners.

Great job as always Team 93. If you can reliably catch & deliver all 18 balls to the HP you'll be first on many team's lists, if not a top seed.




We can be off about 6"-9" on either side.  At a foot we miss 1-2 balls which is fine anyways.



Do you sense in autonomous if the hopper is full and drive over to your chute, or do you wait until driver control? If you can do it in autonomous you'll be even more dangerous.

Good luck this year, and see you at MWR.




Thanks a lot Mike, we do not have a sensor, it would be nice however I don't think it’s needed mainly because your adding complexity to the auto mode.Looking forward to seeing you at MWR as well.



mindboggling... you guys are truly scary- Do you have some kind of brake or something? I can just imagine the times when your partner doesnt have an autonomous, right at 40 seconds you're going to get pounded by an opponent.. (not trying to diss you or be negative, i'm in awe, just curious if you have a device to prevent this)




We do not have a brake, it was discussed, but we have no where to put it.  We will probably drive around til like the 35 sec mark than move back under.  It is pretty easy to position it under the release.  Also we can be up to 1/1/2 feet from the wall and still catch all 18.


Thank you once again to everybody, I'll be posting many more pics and videos most likely on Thursday or Friday.
1.  A robot that can reliably take the 6" steps against opposition and hang will win regionals/nationals.

2. No robot that "caps" as its primary strategy will make it into the finals in any regional or nationals.

3. No robot with 12.5" wheels will make it into finals in any regional or nationals.

4. 75% of all robots with 12.5" wheels will have a badly degraded drive system by the end of the first regional.

5. Scouting will be more important this year than any other year.  Every strategy (except for the one in #1 above) has a hole in it.  Proper planning (even by a box on wheels) can negate almost any strategy.

6.  Because hanging is so devastating, those teams who can do it will need to find a way to get onto the middle platform in autonomy.  Otherwise, they will have to get onto the platform against active opposition.

7.  Over 50% of all matches will have one or more robots on their sides/backs before the end of the match.
Thanks Cory,

Actually we weighed in last night (around midnight) at 119.0. That's full up, with just a few finishing touches to add. I can hardly believe it myself !! :yikes:

The lasgre gear is in on the output shaft and the smaller gear is on the wheel shaft. All of these came in our kit. We havent riiged any special gearings or customizations.

Thanks




Since there were no drawings of the Kit drivetrain this year, it's easy to have problems with the drive.  I think your problem lies in your gears.  You want to reduce the output speed of your motors using those 90 degree gears.  But you've increased the speed by putting the larger gear on the drive, and the smaller gear on the wheel.  Reverse the two gears (smaller on the drive, bigger on the wheel) and your problems should be solved.  Hope this helps!

BEN
Very cool!!! Looks a lot like our design.

Do you have a ball colelctor too?  And how do you release the balls?

Good luck, looks like a winner.
Going out on a limb here...

Prediction:  Things will get broken.




*shakes head*  Now that I think about it, that sounds incredibly crazy and darn near impossible.  Maybe we just did the sane thing and bought some new belts in the off-season.  My memory is a little fuzzy.

.





Would it be legal to buy a new tread and new pulleys and wheels after we ship and then replace our current ones with them at the competition?

If they were exactly the same size and didn't change the design of the robot at all?  :confused:


Question: Does it work on Macs?




Yeah, the keyspan adapter came from a mentor who bought it for his powerbook.  Works great under Linux and OSX.
Motors draw a lot of current because they are put under a high load.  By pushing the motor's beyond 40 amps just by putting more stress on the motors, it would appear that there is too much load in your drive system.  You may have some parts which are not able to move as freely as they would like to.  You also may have problems with parts of your drive train being misaligned.  Any of these issues can cause the motors to draw too much current.

As for my suggestion in solving the problem: put the robot up on blocks and run the drive train.  Stress it.  Watch how the drive train reacts.  See if anything doesn't align.  See if anything hits anything else.  That will help you diagnose the problem.

4. REFEREES WILL HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL!
3. In some games, there will be more penalty flags than balls on the floor.
2. Ball popping maybe common and a crowd pleaser!
1. 13 inch ball travelling at 10m/s becomes lethal to robots

:yikes:
Forgive me for possibly asking a dumb question but aren't you making this way harder than it needs to be?  We've just got an aluminum disk with 30 holes punched in it and the encoder that first gives you.  Our interrupt handler is a whopping shaft_encoder++;
Well, overall, I think that our team did the best that we could. Especially when I'm the only one on the team that does animation. If I had more time or if I had used my time more wisely, I think I could've done better than what we have now. But, I'm happy with the output and glad that all of the hard work is over,...for now.
one thing we have noticed about the drill motors and the supports FIRST supplied for them - the black plastic supports block a lot of air coming from the blower inside the motor.

We experimented with the parts from last year, cutting an angle into the flat sections of plastic, and the increase in airflow from the motors is VERY noticable.

We intend to mod the ones on this years robot if/when we have the motors out of the bot again.
We ran into this problem too.  Much past 20 feet or so the tracker was horribly inaccurate.  It'd find the beacon OK, but it'd be +- 10 degrees, which doesn't help things terribly much.

I completely re-wrote the tracker and receiver code and interrupt routines in order to get a 3 sensor tracker.  I added a third sensor in the middle that simply stares down a bic pen tube and is completely sealed off with electical tape.  Works incredibly well this way, as the tracker needs to be pointing *directly* at the beacon in order to get all three receivers to register.

I can post pictures / code if you want.
Looks hot! These darn WI teams are good, I wish that stupid 269 would post pics of their bot, oh wait :p



P.s. The fast ferry would be a great way for the Canadian teams to get to the Rochester regional next year. ;)



I remember bringing up that very point when we first started talking to FIRST about the regional.

Matt
if the low battery light comes on then you are stalling your motors, you have a weak battery (an old one or one that is not fully charged), or a bad connection somewhere in your power wires.

Im not certain on this, but I believe the blue backup battery only keeps the RC from resetting when the 12V battery drops low - I believe the outputs to the PWMs are still cuttoff at a certain voltage, so yes, if you pull enough power from the 12V battery to drop the voltage below the threshold, then the victors and spikes will be switched off.

Its possible that you have a poor connection in your power wires somewhere. If you have a terminal or wire that is just barely touching, or poorly crimped - it will have a relatively high resistance, and when your motors draw a lot of current, the voltage will be lost across that bad connection

it could be anywhere from the terminals screwed to the battery posts, to the main breaker, your ground stud, the buss box (black square cube thing) your breaker panels - anywhere between your RC and the battery, that causes the RC to 'see' a lower battery voltage under high current conditions.
the PINK team 233 will also be at the omni
I just finished testing exactly this code on the EDU controller. It works fine as long as there are no conflicts with the values that your fast and slow code sections output. I wrote the code for the fast section, and forgot that the slow section would output 127 every 26 msec :) The edu motor sounded really weird as a result. As soon as I figured this out though everything worked.

I am not sure if updating the values that quickly will actually do any good, however. Even if the speed controller can respond this quickly to the change in PWM, the motors and the drivetrain certainly won't. Inertia in the drivetrain will erase all difference between fast and slow updates, I think. If I'm wrong please correct me on this.
I've never used CopyCat, but if it assumes the robot controller of past years, it'll be useless for this years robot since it's a completely different programming language.

It sorta irritates me that the First community continually gives less respect to the software engineering aspect of the project and more respect to the mechanical engineering aspects of the project.  Remember that what seperates a robot from a glorified radio controlled car is the fact that you have to engineer it to be autonomous.

In the past, many teams programmed nothing and simply used the default code.  The addition of autonomous mode was a huge step in the right direction, but I still think the community is doing a lot of hand-holding in this area.  Case in point would be the navigation code that's been written that allows teams to navigate to the IR beacon with no programming.  That's pretty disheartening.

Just my $0.02.
It's fine to call putdata more often than needed, but it would probably be a bad idea to call putdata from an interrupt handler because of timing issues.  The interrupt pin would be disabled for as long as putdata would take to execute.  I'd just set your PWM values and call putdata as you normally do.
If the motors are REALLY overheating, nothing can save them :) Electrical motors don't like spinning slowly. We just melted a drill motor yesterday. Some advice - never allow a motor to sit there with some power applied to it :D This happened to us when the default robot code was uploaded into the RC and an uncalibrated joystick was left connected to the OI for aout 2 minutes. So, either recalibrate speed controllers or create a large "deadzone" in your code.
two things that will decide the game...small balls & being able to hang imho.....2X will have an effect, but not a huge one.....


ah, speaking of hotlanta, any idea what the temperature would be down there during the middle of april? ;)





No hotter than Epcot....i think i might just bring a jacket (traveling north to atlanta will probably be too cold :p )
Yes, this is legal. The rules say that you can bring "identical spares" to the competition.
We have plenty of tem problems with Drill motors....and we simply blow the muffin fan over them and they are totally tamed!

Our CIM motors seem to have a much larger themal mass, and seem to overheat much slower. I suppose if we kept them running for extended periods, they would also turn into red-hot pokers eventually......but our batteries seem to die in about 10 minutes.....

-Quentin :ahh:
Wow.
Baker, Bastoni, Calef ... all in a single thread.
In itself, this should be impetus for teams to stand up, notice, and submit.

How cool would it be to overwhelm judges with all of these wonderful, personalized stories about FIRST's most influential people?

900+ registered teams, and I know every team has AT LEAST one of these stories to tell.  Even if your team hasn't considered it until this late date, a 600 word essay can easily be completed in three days.  Let's celebrate leadership and commitment of the best kind.
You know you're addicted to FIRST when...

...there's a certain type of Body Shop soap that reminds you of robotics... :]
(weird eh?)
246 also generates a large number of wacky quotes. For example, today's meeting yielded "I wonder how many gerbils it would take to make a bandsaw run at the right speed".
I look forward to see your team as a winning entry on the Autodesk DVD next year!
I suppose thats worded wrong, then.  I'll look into it, but I'm guessing that you can search either the body or the title, and not both.

If this is the case, it may not be easily fixed.  As nice as the feature would be, I don't have the time or patience right now to search through (and potentially break) 2500+ lines of code.


Yes, this is legal. The rules say that you can bring "identical spares" to the competition.


HOLD ON A MINUTE GREG :ahh:  ... this is one of those situations that you shouldn't be too quick to answer.  I happen to disagree ...  I suppose if they were ordered before ship date then the "timing" would be OK ... but if the parts they are referring to are truly "identical" then it seems it would not solve their problem.  This is really a question for FIRST.
30? We got a laser cut piece of polystierene with 16 holes and it works fine. I guess what direction the bot is going by assuming that power over 127 is forward and below 127 is reverse. Good for speed, bad for distance :D
We had a similar problem with our drill drive motors last year.  The root cause turned out to be current draw.  We discovered this when we borrowed a portable ammeter from our electrical lab at work.  The solution was to simply lower our gear ratio.  The down side was that we could no longer use the drills in high gear for a high speed.
This is very typical of some designs.  You do not say what your configuraion is so I am going to assume four wheel tank or two wheel with non steering two front wheel.  These types of drive systems use incredible amounts of current when turning.  Again, if there is any friction in your drive train it will manifest itself as high current in the drill motors.  Can you describe the drive train or include a picture?
Stu,
Looks awesome!
Can't wait to see it in action.

A great entry from 1018.

My team, 177, has perrenially had this issue we finally broke down and made omniwheels for the rear.  Our experience shows that having lower friction in the rear wheels increases manueverabilty while retaining control compared to the fronts.  Most teams who saw our bot at the UTC scrimmage can attest to it's speed and manueverabilty with these wheels.  We were also never at a loss for traction.


If this is the case, it may not be easily fixed.  As nice as the feature would be, I don't have the time or patience right now to search through (and potentially break) 2500+ lines of code.




I definetly don't want you to potentially break the code at this point in the season. I was think more that if it wasn't an easy fix, you could report it to the vbulletin developers.


Somoene actually suggested using a wax type substance like armor-all on the tires?  Would that work, or be legal?




No you can not do this, once again a case of "if you don't know don't answer"

**&lt;R15&gt; Lubricants may be used only to reduce friction within the robot. Lubricants shall not be allowed to contaminate the playing field surfaces, balls, or other robots.**

You can use anything that will stay on your wheels, tape, paint, glue. But nothing that will rub off and contaminate the field.
Whoa!  Awesome.

YES YES YES!!!!

what Ben said!

you assembled the transmission backwards - the small gear MUST be on the motor shaft and the large gear on the wheel shaft

man! your wheels must be spinning a couple thousand RPMs when you have them off the floor!

also, it would be better to get the original drill motors and white gearheads in there instead - they are geard down lower than the Chips - and the FIRST transmission was designed for them.

If your motors were destroyed you can buy replacements, you can even buy complete Bosch drills at the hardware store and put them in tonight - it will cost you more, but dropdead date is only 3 days away.
no climbing the big steps for us...we tried to concentrate on ball control, and were very successful.


if the low battery light comes on then you are stalling your motors, you have a weak battery (an old one or one that is not fully charged), or a bad connection somewhere in your power wires.

Im not certain on this, but I believe the blue backup battery only keeps the RC from resetting when the 12V battery drops low - I believe the outputs to the PWMs are still cuttoff at a certain voltage, so yes, if you pull enough power from the 12V battery to drop the voltage below the threshold, then the victors and spikes will be switched off.






Actually, the PWM outputs keep driving even with the main battery disconnected.  I've notice this because after I turn of the breaker, my IR sensors keep scanning.
My daughter lives in pittsburgh, going to college there.

We could all have a party at her apartment!   (maybe not all 3000 of us  :ahh: )

there is a hardrock cafe across the river from downtown - we go there every time we are in pittsburgh - excellent place for dinner.


The Schmoebots had this problem as well. They solved it by simply removing the tires on one end and running on the rims. There's a little bit of slip from the different diameters, but it doesn't seem to cause any problems.





or make a wheel outa lexan or delrin ;)
I'd tend to agree (doesn't hurt that I'm a programmer ;)) - as it is, FIRST is more "For Inspiration of Radio-Controlled Cars and Technology". Yes, remotely controlled devices can be referred to as "robotic", but I think it would be nicer if more emphasis were put on autonomous operation.
ok then maybe the Victors have a minumum voltage, below which they dont function

still comes down to the same cause: either

motors not geared down enough and breakers are opening

bad connection somewhere causing a voltage drop at high current

weak (faulty?) battery?

or the laws of physics are no longer in effect :^)
oh...OOHHHH i get it....wait what?!? from what I can see your robot has the ability to talk and introduce itself as "John"


Forgive me for possibly asking a dumb question but aren't you making this way harder than it needs to be?  We've just got an aluminum disk with 30 holes punched in it and the encoder that first gives you.  Our interrupt handler is a whopping shaft_encoder++;




The wheels on our robot are 12" in diameter. It would be difficult to mount an encoder disk anywhere but on the output shaft, so 30 holes would give us a resolution of 1.25". Not too bad. The down side is that if we get pushed backwards we won't know it. It also takes time to punch 30 holes in a disk, mount the sensors and debug it. We bought a 128 count/rev optical encoder. It gives us a resolution of 3 tenths of an inch, plus direction for free. Its one extra line of code to check the other encoder channel to get the direction. For a tank-drive robot the math is fairly involved to convert the distance measurements to the actual position. We figured that if we're going to do it we should have the best resolution possible.
MAK rocks!

cant wait to see what that all tranlated into in alum and steel

will see you at Pittsburgh

and Cleveland!   :^)
Yes it is legal, as long as one robot does not block both the opponents ball corals at the same time.

By the response I've gotten, it looks like it's just worded strange.
You can search either post OR title, but not both. [without a hack]
The robot is great, but the fact that is only contolled by a human is what makes it special. I've always been interested in robotics and have read a lot about then and built two small ones. (Not that they were very good :)) When I first heard about FIRST, I thought, "That's not real robotics, they are remote controlled." I found out later that there is autonomous time, but the point is still the same. At least in my mind, a robot is a robot because it can function on its own.

Like DeltaCoder said, it helps that I'm a programmer. :)

Helping a team out who isn't so good at programming is ok, but giving them the code doesn't help them learn how to do it next time.
are you guys running 2 cim's? and if you are are you running both motors through one fuse?, because that will definately cause them to blow under any load, the only other thing you could do is to de-sensitize the joystick signal with programming, but don't ask me how to do this, i don't do the programming for our bot.


Whoa! Awesome.

Thanks for the compliment Joe.  Unfortunately we are not able to do either.  Our strategy brainstorming sessions "told" us that those should not be our first priorities.  Additionally we are only a second year team, and we are trying to stay focused on robust designs that are not too complicated.  I can say that we have made incredible strides from last year, both in our design/build process AND our robot's capabilities.
hope That Everybody Does Good!!  :)
Ohh... That's an intresting concept, being able to uncap while hanging...
Good job guys!

hence the reason why I refuse to straight out write code for another team, beyond modular things like a lookup table example. I'll debug code, and rewrite a few lines so it works better, and I'll give examples with pseudocode, but I don't write an entire program for someone.
It was a great success for our team.
We worked out a few kinks in our drive that are now keeping us up and running well. We also found out many details about how the game may turn out being played, and we found out that we can only do certain things in a certain position...  ;)
All in all, it was definitially worth the 2.5 hour drive. We had a great time.

Hey all.  Hope all is going well and your successes are many this week.  I've got a question about wieghing the bot.  We measured earlier and were close, and are weighing all parts as they go on, but we'd still like to weigh the whole thing at once.  Who does this?  What's your techinique and/or piece of technology that you use?
i am taking a shot in the dark here but was team 768 there and if they were how did they do?
you might want to read through your rulebook a bit more thouroughly though because it is in there and you might have missed other key information ;)

My interpretation (someone go ahead and shoot me down) has always been that you can bring any kind of raw material to the competition that you want, if you intend to build something there.  You cannot do ANY kind of alteration to this material during the time between the build period and the event.

"raw material" in this case is anything that you would normally buy rather than make.  Bolts, nuts, gears, treads, etc.

I mean, you are allowed to improve your robot on site...including adding brand new mechanisms...seems to me you'd need to bring something to make that stuff from.

If I'm way off, please let me know.  We are neither rule-stretchers nor rule breakers, and would regret it if we have been misinterpreting this rule.

what? how do i know?well, okay, first my sister joined in, on the team (#47). She told me every thing that they have done. So, just by telling me that, i got so into it. Soon, i got into a after school program called "girls in tech." i didn't relize that it was part of what my sister was into. i went to their OCCRA games. so, i loved it so much and can't wait to go into high school and joined in also. :D hey, you got to love it!! :D

I can personally testify to the size on the operator controls our is one of the teams that must redesign our spiffy control board.

*Also, robots that can control the goal will be very usful as in one of the championship competitions The red alliance shoved there goal into the blue alliances best HP ball coral and the robot was unable to remove it
*Around the bar is going to be the blood zone were robots will be shoving each other out of the way (i.e. RAGE in the Finals)
*Matches will be very close and one shoddy shot or penalty (which there will be many) will have a HUGE effect in the outcomes.
*HP are gods in this game

Best of luck to every in hopes that my formentioned thought will help and thank you to Aces High for another excellent scrimmage

P.S. Just want to thank Geal Force, Team 126, for allowing our HP extra practice during one of their practice rounds. This will not be forgotten and we all wish the best of luck to you guys.
Thank you....it turns out i had 6.1 which couldn't export....
I'm still struggling with how to figure direction.... Any help?
I want to see a match where they catch the balls from both sides.  If they get under theirs...and it drops during auto mode...and the other side doesn't drop until the 45 sec. mark.  I'll be watching for it.  Can you get the first 18 out fast enough to be under the other ball drop at 45 sec?

Again...great job.
We used treads in 2001 and hated them.. but Robbie Extreme (56) used treads also and had a lot of luck with them.  They said that the trick is to put pop-rivets all along the tread down the center.  Then on all of your wheels, cut a groove that the pop rivets will slide in.  This is basically how tanks do it.
FIRSt actually touches on this subject in the rulebook. It is completely legal to get off the shelf parts bought after the ship dae, however you cannot modify the parts in any way between ship date and the competition. Now, if you want, you can assemble any changes you want to make to the drive train at the competition with the raw materials/ off the shelf parts you purchased between ship date and the competition ;)
i want to know what 1 second equals to in this part
1000?
400?

what is it!?!?!?


I'm still struggling with how to figure direction.... Any help?




I'm assuming you have an ISR coded already. Connect the signal pin not connected to the interrupt and ground to the signal and ground pins on digital input number 8. Your ISR will look like this:


volatile signed int distance = 0;

void Int_1_Handler()
{
//check the other encoder channel. you may have
//to switch the comparison value to 1 depending on
//the configuration.
if (rc_dig_in08 == 0)
{
distance++;
}
else
{
distance--;
}
}

The official weigh in is during the practice day of the competition, by the volunteer robot inspecters.

We do our preliminary weigh-ins with a calibrated scale that was surplused from our corporate sponser.

The scale is an extremely accurate one formerly used in our space division.
I think that the jobs of the judges will be a difficult one this year, given the leeway left for interpretation in the rules. I doubt that a judge would call goal tending on an opposing team if their opponents' human players shoot balls at the robots...there will be much interpretation of the rules made by the judges at the competition this year and rulings will probabably differ from each event.
I like the omni wheels and ball claw. What's on the ball claw to allow it to grad better?
a good way to weigh your robot if you don't have access to a shipping scale is to take a bathroom scale and put 2 pieces of 2x4 on it then sit your robot on the 2x4 look at the weight and then subtract the amount of the 2x4.


also please let us know how the transmission problem went and if you need any immediate advise feel free to call me 410-963-6085


Ive used both.  I hate both, but I'm going to stick to my PC.  Back in high school the yearbook staff used Macs with adobe pagemaker and photoshop ranging from OS 8 to OS 9.2 and I tell you that OS 9.2 is total garbage.  I've yet to check out OSX, but aparently from what I've read and heard its a major improvement from the previous versions.  The one thing that really urks me about Macs is the file server that they purchased to store the yearbook.  That thing was down more then it worked.  I think they sent it back and had it replaced/repaired at least 3 times over an 18 month period.  If it wasn't for making backups on zip disks, the 02 yearbook would never have been finished.  The other thing that bothers me is pricing.  The cheapest non-student discount computer that I've seen is 799.  The **laptop** I bought in September was 100 dollars cheaper (after rebates and stuff).  It may not be the most powerful machine ever, but it does everything I need it to do.   I'm not convinced that its worth the extra money for what I need, especially on a college student "budget."   Maybe one day when I aquire some money I'll purchase a mac.  For now, i'm sticking with my pc.




Your sig, on the other hand, indicates some connection to having used Mac OS X, does it not? That is the "Aqua" window bar present in OS X.... ;)
When I was on 992, we threw the robot in the back of a minivan and drove to the nearest FedEx office.  They were more than happy to let us use their scale.
if you are referring to the black area, it is not gripping material, it is actually airplane flooring.  This is very light weight material, and also provides awesome rigidity.  This material is sandwiched by the aluminum plating.
Whats VCC?

is that a thing that would be used in the actual competitions?

Has someone fried their system yet using that port? :)
If the gearbox is assembled correctly, as was suggested in previous posts, then start of by removing the motors and turning the wheels by hand to see if there is any binding through the gearbox. Tweak the gearbox until all binding goes away. If those are 12 inch wheels, they ought to be spinning only 2 or 3 revs per second. 3 revs per second is about 9 feet per second, just to give you a ballpark estimate of speed. If those wheels are turning faster than that, your gear ratio is too high.

Good luck. We've all been there at one time or another. Just don't panic and start blaming anyone. Just concentrate on diagnosing the problem one piece at a time.

Does anyone know the dementions of the top of the ball tee (hieght) where the infered beacon?

Please need an answer A.S.A.P.
Thank You




It would help if you used **Dimensions**.  I'm pretty sure you can find them [http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/2004WoodFieldElements-Corral_Tee-Corral_Panel.pdf](http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/2004WoodFieldElements-Corral_Tee-Corral_Panel.pdf)  or  [http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/2004_BALL_TEE_Dimensional_LAYOUT.pdf](http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/2004_BALL_TEE_Dimensional_LAYOUT.pdf) .

Rob, the second drawing shows the IR to be 3' 8" or 44" .
Awsome robot design....we had something like this on the drawing board, but we changed horses and went to another concept.

I still like that idea, and think you will do quite well with it.

I hope to see you at the competition.....

Good luck,

:D
We'll go.

I probably have 29 people going.


In the past, many teams programmed nothing and simply used the default code.  The addition of autonomous mode was a huge step in the right direction, but I still think the community is doing a lot of hand-holding in this area.  Case in point would be the navigation code that's been written that allows teams to navigate to the IR beacon with no programming.  That's pretty disheartening.




The code to navigate to the IR beacon is sub-optimal. As they said at the Kickoff, there is a lot of room for improvement. The reason the code is included is to give people who have never thought about how to control a robot autonomously a place to start.

Also, if you want a mechanical analogue to the software "hand-holding", look no further than the working drive train included in this year's kit. It will help rookies and teams short on resources to compete without making them powerhouses or overly limiting those teams that attempt something more complex.

The relaxed additional electronics rules and the new brain have gone a long way to making electronics and software equal partners to mechanics in the building-a-FIRST-robot equation.
hmm, the two drawings do appear to be conflicting with each other. I would trust the one I posted more since thats the updated ones they posted and its labeled the 2004 field elements.
It's kind of too late for this season, but for future reference http://www.aircable.net/ sells cables that can communicate at up to 30 ft wirelessly. One side has to be plugged into a wall, but the other can be attached just like a normal serial cable with no extra battery drain. They don't require any special configuration of the software either. :ahh: I don't actually have them, so I can't verify that they are a legitimate company, but just in case anyone wants to give it a try. :)


I want to see a match where they catch the balls from both sides.  If they get under theirs...and it drops during auto mode...and the other side doesn't drop until the 45 sec. mark.  I'll be watching for it.  Can you get the first 18 out fast enough to be under the other ball drop at 45 sec?

Again...great job.




We wouldn't need to get all 18 out, I am guessing that our collector can hold 30 balls with our arms open.

That would be the optimal match though for us.

Looks pretty cool.  I don't like the price much and I'm pretty confident that you could find cheaper than that, though don't quote me on that.

I don't know.. I thought it seemed easier to read in the second one.  Your pdf made it hard to know if that was the to the pvc or to the IR.  Anyway they would take it down if it was wrong.  I think the 37" is to the pvc and not to the top of the IR.
I'm rather confused... ha ha ha, programming newbie...

Our Spike connected to the compressor is hooked up to realay port 8, and the code under ifi_aliases.h consists of:

#define relay8_fwd      LATDbits.LATD7
#define relay8_rev      LATJbits.LATJ0

All the other ports say LATEbits instead of J, and Would have progressed consecutively, so, I think the bottom line should say LATEbits.LATE8, but I'm not sure.

Our spike is now running on red, and it is shaking and as hot as the above have described. Should I change this bottom line to what I thought, or what should I change it to?

Thanks,
Charley.


When I try to build, I get this error message:
Couldn't locate build tool. Check tool locations.
BUILD FAILED: Mon Feb 23 08:39:51 2004

What build tool are they referring to? Did I forget to download something? Help me please



This thread gives a description of how to correct your toolsuite.
/t/need-mplab-help-asap/49457/1


and I don't think the second foot was ever used after that.



Though it was still tested before each match....

I may have won, but you got the picture.  I couldn't seem to find one I liked.
We did pretty well, but we REALLY underestimated rendering and all.  Even with simple geometry and low polygon counts (we're newbs) and few reflective surfaces we still churned out some huge render times.  Anyways, we didn't submit for the award but be on the lookout for next year, it's gonna be a killer!
Another thing that I forgot to mention was that our team always plays Twister at our hotel every night. Maybe teams at Chicago and Atlanta could also play too.


i want to know what 1 second equals to in this part
1000?
400?

what is it!?!?!?




The processor runs at 10 MHz, 10,000,000 clock cycles per second.  The joystick info (etc) is only updated every 10 MHz / (2^18).  That's 10,000,000 divided by 2 raised to the 18th power. 2^18 is 262144.  So 10,000,000 divided by 262144 is 38.1469... cycles per second.  One cycle has a duration of 1 / 38.14... = 0.0262144 second, or 26.2 milliseconds (ms).

So in one second, there are 38 or 39 cycles of the "main loop".

You can pre-calculate certain fixed periods of time (using pocket calculator or the Windows calculator accessory, not the robot controller), converting from seconds to cycles of 38 Hz:

To know when a certain pre-determined amount of time has passed, say, 11.7 seconds, figure out how many counts that would be:

11.7 / .0262144 = 446.3195801

and round to the nearest integer, because the controller works fastest with integers:  446.

A quicker way?  Mutliply seconds by 38:

11.7 * 38 = 444.60000

which is 445 when rounded.  A little different than 446.  An even faster way that you could do in your head:

11.7 * 38 is about: 12 * 40 = 480

Close enough?  Think like an engineer and make that decision yourself!

Remember, to count these cycles, declare a "static" variable.  "static" means that the variable isn't lost every 26.2 ms cycle, which could happen otherwise.


static unsigned int cycleCounter = 0;


You might have some code that looks like this:


if ( cycleCounter < 446 )
{
// this part gets used for the first 11.7 seconds
}
else
{
// this part gets used after the first 11.7 seconds has passed.
}

cycleCounter++;  // increase the cycle counter by 1.

goto statements are BAD. Use a do-while or something. :P




Hmm, a non-believer.  What regionals are you going to?  We need some time to learn you in the wonderous ways of the ever-confusing Goto.  Eventually it's followers will rise to power.

Until then, Goto 20.(ah, the simple days of basic)
Yep, looks all to familiar. We've had people in the past rupture our balls and then throw them in our storage closet for some unsuspecting person to try to reinflate them. We did have some of the small red balls puncture this year and I successfully repaired them by using a rubber tube repair kit from NAPA or if they had a small hole (pencil point size) I used Fix-A-Flat to inflate them. If you ever used that stuff it is essentially glue in a can and those balls now have an additional membrane making up thier "skin". I also sacrificed a needle point adapter doing that but if I try soaking it in laquer thinner I may be able to reclaim it.
Gotta be **Orange**. Not even the Flourencent Green  can beat it! heh, sorry 365.  :p
We have two shirts this year, one is white and the other is navy

but then there is always that one freshman who forgets their shirt and shows up on the bus in a gray t-shirt with '236' written on the back in magic marker
gotta love the frosh
Not to brag or anything....

We weigh 63 lbs with out the battery and the 18 pound arm. So a grand total of about 80 lbs right now.

Also we have a goal gripper, and side "wings" to push balls.

Hopefully we didn't build it TOO light... (hope duribility isn't a problem)

Good luck yall!

::enters detective mode::

Well, it doesn't look like precision work.  Looks like the culprit was in a rush.  You can tell by the way they duct taped the wound.  We need to look for a motive.  What kind of grudge could someone have held against the victim?  Could the victim have had some dirt on someone?  Have you determined the weapon used?  Unfortunately, unless someone comes clean, these kind of cases almost never get solved.  That poor ball... it was so young...  My condolences to it's family and friends.

In all seriousness, have you tried soldering it back together?  No, I'm serious.  Heat up where any tear may be and melt it back together.  Not the strongest hold in the world, but it will still hold up to normal robot interaction.

Ah ha!  It was the robot all along! :D
Were using the globe motor direct driving a 1 inch shaft, supported on both sides by the kit pillow blocks that are bloted to the frame. The ratchet mechanism is top secret  :D

Good luck!

Team Name: EagleBotics

Our high school mascot is the Eagle, and our teachers wanted our name to be associated with the school, so Eagle mixed with Robotics = Eaglebotics
rope
just got back from the utc scrimmage... i saw one of the official "2x" balls, and there were no ridges.. is this correct?


Well its pretty obvious what it is, but i have one question.  Why didn't you just save the effort, money, and weight by buying one off the shelf?




Because we didn't see any that fit our criteria and was in stock at Digikey, and because it was a fun learning experience.


CRLF is
from the perspective of printf(), right?  Just making sure I'm bot being an idiot.




I had just
in the printf calls, \r is unneeded (afaik)
Try reinstalling, and when it gives you a large list of checkboxes asking if it should change PATHs and such, check all of them.
I believe that there are a few #define statements in one of the header file that change PWMs 13-16 to either IFI_PWM or USER_CCP.  That might be what you're looking for...
I think they have ridges but they shouldn't be a problem for getting a seal with what you are using.  There is some good non-pourous foam that you can use if that fails.  But I doubt it would.

Quick questions.  How do you get all three to have good placement on the ball?  Can you pick the ball up if only two get a good seal?  Is that a problem sometimes?
note that if you pause the robot, you should still be calling putdata every 26.2ms, otherwise the frc will shut down.

"Yellow Wave" -- We took everyone with us to regionals and had penants and our team color is yellow (or gold).  We won the team spirit and were champion at LSR.  The announcer began the refer to our team as the yellow wave of 1108  because the amount of yellow and penants.  He was the announcing in our division at national so we were the "yellow wave".
Red cause Cornell is Red and so is our High School

Code Red cause it sounds either dangerous or funny (think homeland security).

It was changed to Code Red Robotics in the 2nd year from Red B^2.
The Team I came from is the Robo Wizards.

The way  The team got that name was in Orlando 2000. I believe the 522 coaches were wandering around the Gift Shops in disney. They had came across a Wizard Hat and A Wizard doll *not sure about the doll) and they came to an aggreement that wouldn't it be great to be called the "RoboWizards" ! As far the Team colors Purple and Silver just go together lol  :D  ;)   :cool:  :)
today at quincy there was a lot of ways of scoring and de-scoring the 2x ball... a few in particular were very good at it...

with the 2x ball thrown into an oppeonets net could be CRITICAL in the begining/middle of the match, where the other team is just starting to get thier small balls into their coralls... capping then would make 1 less goal to shoot at, and if you take out the stationary goal, and THEN take thier small goal to your end... it could make it very hard to score period...
we got our name by linking our mascots the gaels, and our sponsor are Sikorsky and have the black hawk helicopter so we became the gaelhawks


We are using the van door motors. The diameter of the winch is 5/8" and it doesn't backdrive




Same here.  We have a ratchet we can add if we need to but we haven't had too.  The van door motor works great if you rotate it around a small diameter.  And the small diameter will make backdriving more difficult.  Especially with braking.

Close to your andy too.  We used the pillow blocks with the 5/8" shaft.  And our ratchet is top secret too.


Hey is that the name of your bot? That was the name of our bot last year!! Haha. What school are you guys from? Which regionals are you going to?




Hey - didn't mean to steal your name - it was unintentional. Anyway, we're a third-year team from Plainedge HS, which is in N. Massapequa on Long Island. We go to the SBPLI Regional. I actually came up with that name after several other (less favorable) suggestions including "Six Pack" (even though we now have just four wheels), "Kill Switch", and "The Juice." Was yours spelled with the "k" too?

Anyway here is our lifting method revealed:
That extrusion arm is rotated to vertical pneumatically (a cylinder out of view). Then, a cable-pully-winch system telescopes the arm to the right height. The winch itself doesn't have enough power to lift the robot. That's where that huge cylinder comes in. It has a steel cable that attaches directly to the top extrusion (the one with the hook) and pulls it down (or, pulls the rest of the robot up). The arm doubles (triples?) as a big-ball-knocker-outer and a small-yellow-ball-getter-offer (if we ever get our autonomous down).

The result: (sorry for the low-quality image)

It would make it hard to score..But again you still want them to score..It's a fine balance and that's what makes this years game so challenging and fun.  I look forward to see how everyone attacks this problem and how it works out in the end.  We will find out soon enough.
Well, for one thing, IE5 is the best browser hands down for those stuck on Mac OS 9. Plus, Safari only works in Jaguar and up. I'll fix it some time.

we did pretty good for our ghetto PVC arm, tho... 2nd place
I believe there's another thread about your drive train... look there.

As for pneumatics, you'll want to hook them up to solenoids, and then power the solenoids off of spikes (relays). Then, use the relayX_fwd and relayX_rev (X = 1 to 8) to control the various relays. Likewise, use the pX_sw_BLAH (X = 1 to 8 again, BLAH is the name of the specific switch/button - see ifi_aliases.h).
Our first year we were the "PHS Robo Dawgs" because our school mascott is the Bull Dog, of corse every one despised the name, (oh and uh no offence to any other robodogs team) and no one quite nows how it came about but it did so last year every one practicly shouted "NEW NAME!" So students would think up an idea and make a presentation to the team, then the team voted on the one they liked best. I designed the logo, and thought up the name "Cutting Edge" and it was voted for. It's now our permanent name. So my advice: Think one up! Be cleaver! And be creative. Then ask for a vote on it. :)
Good job...Our animation team finally finishes rendering today..Add sound and they should be done soon..Hopefully they will get it posted on our website.  I enjoyed the robotic voice over.
...When you continue to post the first thing that pops into your head to be the 1000th. post....!

knights = school mascot


Thank you, Amber.  That sounds like exactly what I had in mind and Portland is reasonably close.  If I had a car out here, I'd drive down there and pick up the stuff myself.

By any chance, do you know how much it may cost, approximately?  We're a bit poor as a check we were waiting on hasn't yet arrived, to my knowledge.




Rip-stop usually comes on rolls in widths of 54" to 60" and at RCT can cost anywhere from 50 cents to $10.00 a yard. You should be able to purchase it by the yard. If they give you a catalog to look at, start with the blue pages first (if they still do that) and they will have the cheapest closeout stuff there. Generally though, it's all cheap compared to most fabric stores,.....plus, you can't find that stuff in most fabric stores. It's an independant (cheap) outerwear designer's dream.

Oh and they also deliver nationwide since they are a mail-order oufit.
Ask for samples of "HEAVYWEIGHT, RIP-STOP, NYLON" sometimes they will have the word "MACHO" in the description to indicate strength. I worked with some a few years back and it was like a nylon version of canvas that put regular canvas to shame in a paper thin sheet. You call them, they send you swatches for free, then you order and they ship it to you. You don't have to drive.


Not sure if I missed something in my CIS classes, but can someone offer some insight into this behavior?


int foo;
foo = 127 + 127;
printf ("%16b | %d
", foo, foo);
// prints: "1111 1111 1111 1110 | -2"



Is this a bug in the printf code, or is the compiler and microchip actually representing this using ones for the first 15 significant digits and a zero at the least significant position?




The compiler has a documented non-standard behavior that may relate to this. See below, from the C18 compiler reference manual (available on the Microchip site).

2.7 ISO DIVERGENCES

2.7.1 Integer Promotions
ISO mandates that all arithmetic be performed at int precision or greater. By default, MPLAB C18 will perform arithmetic at the size of the largest operand, even if both operands are smaller than an int. The ISO mandated behavior can be instated via the -Oi command-line option.

For example:


unsigned char a, b;
unsigned i;
a = b = 0x80;
i = a + b; /* ISO requires that i == 0x100, but in C18 i == 0 */


Note that this divergence also applies to constant literals. The chosen type for constant literals is the first one from the appropriate group that can represent the value of the constant without overflow.

For example:


#define A 0x10 /* A will be considered a char unless -Oi specified */
#define B 0x10 /* B will be considered a char unless -Oi specified */
#define C (A) * (B)
unsigned i;
i = C; /* ISO requires that i == 0x100, but in C18 i == 0 */



=====

It is confusing. I think you could cast the literal as an (int):


foo = (int)127 + (int)127;

Or maybe this?


foo = 127L + 127L;

I haven't tried these.
just make sure you cast all of the variables you pass to printf as (int).
We are using 5 motors and 6 pnuematic cylinders this year. Our arm is all pnuematic to hoist ourselves up to the bar. We also have two to shift our transmissions from high to low and vice-versa. We have 4 motors for our tank style drive train this year. We have a Bosch and a cim geared together on each side. And if you're wondering about the 5th motor, I can't tell you- it's top secret and it's also something I haven't seen on any other robots on CD. If I told you this would be my last post as my team would kill me for letting the cat out of the bag. :D  I will tell you one thing though, pay attention to team 237 at competitions ( Hartford and Trenton) and the nationals in Atlanta! :)


We ran out of speed controllers (our "genius" mechanics decided that we needed that many motors) and we are using relays and spikes right now.  I am trying to use relays in the code and hitting some problems.  Here is what I have now.

if(p3_sw_aux1 == 1){
relay1_fwd = 127;
relay1_rev = 0;
}

else if(p3_sw_aux2 == 1){
relay1_fwd = 0;
relay1_rev = 127;
}


else
relay1_fwd = 254;
relay1_rev = 0;

the p3_sw_aux1 part appears to work and the motor doesn't move when nothing is done to it.  But we are having some problems with that p3_sw_aux2 part.  Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.





Relay outputs are 1 or 0 values, forward is 1 (on) or 0 (off), same for reverse. They have no speed control. This also means you can assign values directly from buttons. I'm not exactly sure what you were going for, but this will make aux1 make relay1 go forward, aux2 make relay1 go backward, neither button and relay outputs no power:



relay_1_fwd = p3_sw_aux1;
relay_1_rev = p3_sw_aux2;



Hope this helps.


Quincy also had there game going today.
Beware ball handlers thats all I have to say.
And if you think you can pull other robots and goals around there is always someone better:D
This year is going to be fun. being alot of spares;)




#1 yes quincy was awsome today...

#2 amen

#3 yep yep yep

#4 understatement!!! =P
the relayX_fwd and relayX_rev variables don't function like pwm outputs - just assign them a value of 1 or 0.
Since we haven't gotten it to go straight with any consistancy, we are going to just let it run wherever it wants and take it from there.
well the links down im guessing because its over! lol... is there anyway for someone to split up the file and make a series of vids from some of the matches?
And......................it works.

Thank you to Vladimir and deltacoder.
the mobile goal is in the center of the field, and the dimesions of the field are in the manual - Im pretty sure its 48 feet long

there are two pressure switches - one is digital On/Off and has two screws for wires, and one is analog and has three wires - check the robot section of the manual for the proper way to connect them - the digital one goes to the digital inputs on the RC - you will have to sacrifice a pwm cable to connect it to the digital inputs, or buy the right connector and use the small gauge (grey) two wire cable that came in the kit of parts (KOP)

there is an input and a relay output already configured in the default code to run the relay (compressor) until the digital sensor detects high pressure, then turn the compressor off until the pressure drops below its lower trip point.

the default code is described in detail in the users guide in the documents section of innovationfirst.com.

I know everyone is in crunch mode right now - when you get a chance go through those documents - if you are working on the RC you will really want to know them inside out when you get to the regionals and something is not exactly right with your machine :c)
2 Bosch Drills
2 F-P
1 Van door
5 Cylinders

What they are used for?  Only time will tell.
glad your up and okay... wounds will heal in due time...
the receiver is a three pin device - looks like a square with a lens on one side - you should have gotten 4 in the KOP . you connect it directly to a PWM cable, but you have to cross the wires over - check the documents section of innovationfirst.com  - there is a whole page of links to files on the IR under 'beacon' in the list of docs.
here it is, the first look at team 174's SnoBot. This is the first time we got it to hang, it was the first try and it was unassisted!
The ultimate engineering attitude: "Why? 'cause we can." Why not? :)
the gyro actually is a yaw rate sensor - it tells you how fast the bot is turning on one axis (usually you point the axis up so you can tell how fast your bot is turning on the playfield as it steers).

there has been a lot of discussion and explainations - try the search function up in the orange bar - and search on gyro or yaw - you will probabally find what you need to know faster than I can type it out.
gnormhurst,
Thank you for that incredibly detailed, quick, and accurate post.  I'll make sure to read the C18 tech docs as soon as I can find the time.  So far I've been very happy with how compliant the compiler is.  I think you hit the nail on the head.

I hacked a macro to manipulate the datatypes I wanted to work with, but I *hate* macros.  I think I might just use the command line option you mentioned, after I research it's overall implications.

deltacoder1020,
If you look over my examples, the type of data I was passing to printf was already int.  re-casting it inside the printf statement won't change anything.
new picture are up

the robot has taken on a all new look.  a lot faster to climb and hang. the drive train can move almost anything.


few days left. All the pictures will be up by friday

if anybody could give feed back on our web site that would be great.

we were trying to make it easy for others to see this year robot and past robots.


How would you program a gyro and a yaw sensor? Also what specifically does a gyro and a yaw sensor return? Finally how do you install this? Thanks




I'm looking at last year's. It's BEI GyroChip Micromachined Angular Rate Sensor. I'm basing this on the spec sheet, I haven't used it, so confirmation would be nice! :yikes:

You would add the output to a variable ("Compass") once a second, like:


Compass = (char)(Compass + (int)(rc_ana_in01 - 127))


Like I said, once a second (Or what ever is convienient, I'd use a interupt if you know how).

Hopefully that gets you started, good luck!
We used suction cups last year so no one could push us off the platform.  I can't believe we didn't think of that this year.  We found one and tried it and they work really good but we already have a good design and don't have time to change it now.
Wouldn't it be that one is called, then in the middle of it the other is called? It would just bog down the proc, I think. try it!
I was at the UTC Scrimmage today, and did some refing.   Overall, I think teams were too worried about getting their robot working, to really play the game the way they intended to.
Anyway, some of the strategies used were:
Horde small balls into HP.  Most balls wins
Use big ball.  I only saw 2 teams do it succesfully, only 1 of them more than once.
Block chutes with moveable goals.
Hang on bar right away / prevent other team from hanging (The finals came down to the 2 robots who hung the best facing off).

Thats really it.
[Here's some pictures I got of robots and good action shots](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/index1.htm)
[And here's the rest of them](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/crappy/index.htm).  These ones are dark or blurry.
Here's a cool trick for the gyro sensors:

have your code print out a debug value, one per line, of the gyro sensor, and an increasing value before it.  So you get this:

1,127
2,127
3,127
etc...

Use hyperterm or some other terminal program with a large scrollback buffer, attach a long cable, and drive your robot up a ramp or some object you want to climb while capturing the output.  Copy and paste the entire thing into a text file with csv at the end, so foobar.csv or what not.  Open the file in excel and graph it.  It's great for finding thresholds and understanding what the gyro is trying to tell you at various points along the way.
We have some video up now. I don't know if it will work b/c it's supposed to be restricted, but here it is anyway:

In the Swamp shop 179 180 and 1251 got some full scale practice done. swampthing worked fine it caps and uncaps balls with no troubble. Spam had some control broblems, tho they blew us all away with their Holonomic Omni Drive. and 1251 got their Lasso device broken by swampthing and i helped them make an aluninum pice to make it work better.

GO TEAMS!!! I Had great Time An were All Glad you came
I would guess that mplab uses ansi (ascii, 1 byte) letters. It's based on the compiler, since it translates strings to binary. that's also where
stuff comes from.


That's neat. :) It's not too often you see people making thier own encoders from scratch.



Instead of spending $50+ on each encoder, we spent a total of (maybe) $5, and it works quite well.  I wired them up with a buffer and comparator to provide a digital output, which goes to two interrupt pins.  Works great  :D
I don't know of a single website off hand but I do know that a lot of the different veteran teams websites contain pictures and sometimes descriptions of the previous years games. I do know that our teams site will (www.team237.com) but it is a relatively new site and some of the links aren't up yet.
I would do it anyway. The path you posted is 67. Real, real close. I put my stuff in C:\FRCCode\_Projectname\*. Put a folder shortcut on the desktop if you really want it on there (PM me, and I'll tell you how).

The path of the exe and the h doesn't matter; I think that's passed in the command-line args.


is there any reason why one can't turn the 4 interupt handlers into function with an extra argument telling which ir sensor picked it up? it wouldn't be that hard, but maybe two interupts may be caled at the same time and they might fight eachother. who knows? do you?

-Kesich




It completely depends on your definition of "streamlined."

Generally speaking, you want interrupt handlers to be as fast as possible and to do as little "work" as they can.  From this perspective, duplicating large sections of code is more desirable than calling a subroutine, which will cause a "context switch" so to speak...  Push the stack down, create new local variables, etc...

With that said, the overhead involved in calling a subroutine is *very* small, so it might be worth it to save code space by using a generalized function.  As for two interrupts fighting with each other, the setup at present is that all 4 IR sensors are tied to the single low priority interrupt pin, so they'll never fight each other.

Other than that...  Try it and see.  I'm about to massively re-work the IR tracking code to use a single tracker with 3 IR sensors rather than 2 dual sensor trackers.  The idea will be to have the middle sensor have nothing but a very narrow tunnel vision.  I'll let you know if I run into problems generalizing the current implementation.

We don't need 2 trackers to calculate distance, we'll be using the tracker mostly for turning, so it's more important for us to get a dead-accurate lock on one of the beacons.
RAGE is sad that there is no red. LOL :D


I believe that there are a few #define statements in one of the header file that change PWMs 13-16 to either IFI_PWM or USER_CCP.  That might be what you're looking for...




No, that's not it. The Setup_PWM_Output_Type() function is to set up the specifics of the PWM signal. if you don't use IFI_PWM for all 4, you have to set it up yourself (see comment in the default code). this is done in User_Initialization().

Thank you to team 179 for hosting that. It really helped us. We weren't really having control problems exactly; we just moved things by hand so that we could be there to stop or catch anything if it didn't work. The switches have been tested and work fine. The driving of the omni-directional drivetrain was a little crazy, but we tweaked it a bit. Most of the problems are getting used to driving the thing since it is very different than tank treads. Our drivers got a lot of practice on your field today and we think we got the science down, for now. Lets see if that is still true at UCF.


How do you grind down drill motor gears? Is this an safe thing to do? We don't need the gear but we want to use the motor.

~Fred




I don't know if it is safe or not, but we have done ot with excellent results.  Other teams say they have not had such sucess though.  I don't remember exactly what we did, but i can ask the kid who did it.
Ok, i believe you. Actually ours was spelled Tork, with the oppisite caps so i guess its "different" Were in San Jose, CA and are in the Sacramento and Silicon Valley regionals. Unless you have some west coast contacts ;). Our bots caps (doesnt seem theres many of us :)). Anyways, good luck!
-Jackson
yeah we had problems but we'll figure them out-- it's not a spam bot without a million problems

but thanks swampthing for letting us test!!! spam luvs u guys
As for the first part, ask Kevin.

As for the second part, I think that printf is the only one you can exclude, but only if you aren't using printf() anywhere. And this year's mem is huge, so if you filled it already, tell us!
That is sooo awsome!!! when my team and i saw it we were all freaking out it looks so cool!!! Suction cups didnt even cross my mind but now i totally wish it did! everyone was comparing is to ...i think star wars or something... but it was sooo cool! good luck to you i hope it works out for you... :D
READ THE DEFAULT CODE!!!

We're doing the same drive, except that they're geared together. Make sure the free speeds match, but that's a mechanical thing.
Woo, old post back up.

I like manga/anime just as much as any good book.

In speaking of Shonen Jump, I like it for a few of the manga, Naruto, Shaman King, and Hikaru No Go. One Piece, and Yu Yu Hakasho aren't bad. But the rest are just crappy. Naruto is awesome, over the rest. It's awesome, I'd rather watch/read Naruto or Cowboy Bebop over most anime.

Time to test your knowledge. Who's heard of the following anime/manga:
Battle Royal, and Hell Sing. You get a cookie if you have.

er... where do I ask him, or may he see this post?
And I did fill it up :D, Its a mix of a heavily modified tracker, a math library, and my drive system that (hopefully) makes accurate speed/power ajustments relitive to the maximum speed of the bot as seen with the encoders. Thanks!
How well does the servo shift it?

Having the same problem too.  Quicktime DV/NTSC codec is bad.  The Quicktime Cinepak one is even worse.  We'll submit it like that though.  Just as a comparison, we exported our animation in the sorensen 3 codec (which comes with quicktime), and it was 1/3 the size and 10x the quality at least.  That'll probably be the version for our own keeping and the internet version.

I think that that's what I was talking about, sorry, I didn't have the code in front of me...


This is our first year as a team, and we have no idea how to switch channels.  We heard about usinga dongle, or something, but have no idea where to get one, (or build one).  Anyone have any help? :confused:



Check out innovationfirst.org, and look at the OI documentation.
Specifically, the competition port area...

there's something about 4 guys alone in a crate for a few hours or a couple days. locked away and without food or light! :ahh: . kinda turns ur  :D  to a  :yikes: . lol. um kiddin man ya'll have fun
Interesting way to cut down on travel costs for your team. :p
We rendered everything in .mov and then transfered via pen drive to an ibook and used imovie to compile everthing.  Worked pretty good.
Very cool.  The 4 way split screen was a really neat idea.  The voiceovers maybe could have a had a little more 'impact'


Congratulations to teams 1099, 782, 839, and 173 on winning the UTC scrimmage in Suffield, CT.  Our alliance of teams was great-we were able to play many aspects of the game well.

Also congratulations to teams 716, 195, and two other teams (sorry I forgot what numbers you guys were).  You guys were a great alliance as well. :cool:



Congradulations to you as well becuase you would have been a formidable opponent with that arm of yours, very nice work.  I would like to thank team 1099 for picking us and team 839 for being a great alliance partner.
Well top secret rachets are all nifty and all, but we're using a window motor driving a winch that we bought at a boat store.  If you're in a time crunch, which you must be by now, I think this is your quickest option.  Just go to a boat store, look for a lightweight winch with a removeable handcrank that looks like it'll be easy to adapt the van door or window lift motor to.
The motor is the same as the 2003 van door.
i got this...

There was a problem:
• There was a temporary problem with the server. Please try again shortly.
• The password is incorrect.
• The league is not in pre-draft mode.

*edit* worked second time... im in

You guys did a good job of defense on the last match stopping the other alliance from getting to the bar.  We were able to get up on the bar and get up 50 points ahead.
I've tried several times and can't get the "2004 animation" link to work. :confused:  Does anyone else have this problem? I'm connecting through a LAN to a broadband cable modem and I also have quick time already installed on my laptop.
We've got two globe motors pulling us up with an interesting pully system (something like 20 feet of chain. . .)

It may take you a while to view it since it is a 180mb file.  I just played it in the browser and it worked fine.  When you click on it, it should play in the browser, and if you right click and choose 'save target as' you can save it to your computer.  I recommend the second so that we can save up on bandwith. :]


Given that A and B are the lengths of the segments of the line between the beacons bisected by a perpendicular line to your robot of length C and the angles from that perpendicular to the beacons are given as T1 and T2.




You're trig is fine.

I've also been playing around with using the IR beacons to keep track of absolute position, and I've come up against a few ... obstacles.  So maybe you can help me.

It's just that it's not so easy to keep track of those two angles, T1 and T2.

At the beginning of a match, you know both your position and heading (because you know where you've put your bot).  Hence you can quickly calculate T1 and T2, as well as A, B, and C.

(You may recall from your old trig class that this is the angle-side-angle triangle congruency theorem.)

If you go straight ahead, then you can still keep reading off T1 and T2 because the altitude constructed from your bot to the midline of the field is still in the same place.

In fact, as long as the bot is perpendicular to that midline, you can figure out exactly where you are.

If you turn somewhere along the line, you can still find T1 and T2 *as*long*as* you know the angle from that altitude to a line parallel to your robot.  This angle is your heading.  You have a number of ways to keep track of heading -- you can use a gyro to sense your angular velocity, you can mount encoders on your wheels to count revolutions, and so forth.

However, your absolute position (i.e., the values of A, B, and C) will only be as accurate as your heading; in fact it will be slightly less accurate because of the (presumably small) amount of error introduced by the IR sensors.

The upshot of all this is that if you want to know you're absolute position, it's probably a little easier and little simpler to just use gyros and/or rotary encoders, which in the above setup would be necessary anyway.  My conclusion: that if your autonomous objective is to shoot towards the 10 point ball, use the IR trackers.  You don't even need any trig to do that; it's easy to find your distance *relative* to one beacon or the other.  But at this time (which is pretty late) I haven't come up with any way to use the IR trackers to gauge *absolute* position.

I'm not saying it can't be done; I just haven't found a way.  For now, I'm stuck with plain, old, dead reckoning.  If any other team has a solution, I would be eager to hear it.
very nice guys, good luck!
Unfortunetly, the scrimmage ran behind due to field problems, so they stopped the matches and went the finals after the teams had only two matches. The teams who didn't get picked were kind of grr about that, understandably.


On a brighter note, my team managed to get both the lowest and highest score of the day!


I'm using minicom in unix to read back the data from printf...  How the heck do I get a new line so I can get a scrolling set of values rather than just a single line that always overwrites itself?  I've tried all permutations of \r and
together.  Do I need to set my terminal to something specific, vt100 or ansi or something?




This probably won't help:  I wanted to achieve the same thing (single, overwriting line) using the IFI loader's Terminal window.  I tried \r, but it had the same result as
.

I glanced at printf_lib.c and saw some stuff about \r, so there's hope.  Have a look at printf_lib.c

nice, just what i was looking for....anyone have pre-1999 games?


I wasnt fortunate to make it to one of these scrimages today, as we just had too much to do on the robot.  However, I was wondering how they went.  In the past, they have shown significant insight into the game.  So, if anyone can post some reflections on them, I think it would be a great help to all.  Thanks.




Team 64 would like to thank the 10 teams from the Phoenix/Tucson area who came to our 7th Annual "Duel in the Desert".  The action was much better than I expected with almost a week to go before shipping.  Several teams were able to gain axcess to the platforms.  Three teams were able to hang.  No one used the IR beacon in auto mode, though a few teams said they were working on it.  Most robots (even the rookies) showed exceptional speed.  A few teams realized how top heavy they were (tipping over was not uncommon especially when carrying the big balls.)  Many teams used the pneumatic tires.  Special acknowledgement to Team 1011 for their "Swerve2" driving system.

What suprised me the most was how little time two minutes is when you are trying to accomplish just a few things in this years game.

The suction cups are for the 2x multiplier balls. It was a little tricky to maneuver at first, but one you get the hang of it, it works fantastic. We have to cylinders, one connected to a solenoid, the other connected only to the suction cups. When the former is activated, it pulls the stroke of the second cynlinder out with it, evacuating the air nicely. The hold is excellent.
Let me see what I can do. . .

Our pressure switch code is wicked simple:

The pressure switch is on digital input 8, and the compressor is on relay 8.

in the initialization routine

relay8_fwd = 1;     //Start with compressor on


In the default routine:

if(!rc_dig_in18)
{
relay8_fwd = 1;     // If low air pressure, turn on
}else{
relay8_fwd = 0;     // If high air pressure, turn off
}
I forgot to add, all three have to have a good seal, or else it won't work. We've toyed with a few ideas, but nothings worked too well yet.
I'm back in.

:yikes: :yikes: My eyes hurt from that dinner-plate type action. :yikes: :yikes: One word: OPTIMIZE. I hear it's huge. I see why you asked about printf. At this point, do conditional compilation of the debug stuff. But unfortunately, most of IFI's stuff stays. Good Luck! (your gonna need it.)
Our [team](http://www.x-cats.org) has a history section with pictures of past robots and such but it isn't very thorough explaining the previous years games, I'm afraid.
Excellent job Ryan and the 234 animation crew!  It's worth every bit of the 180mb.  Good luck in the competitions.
Thanks, I did the "save target as" and I got it to work. You definitely have some excellent animators on your team. :)


Since we haven't gotten it to go straight with any consistancy, we are going to just let it run wherever it wants and take it from there.




Well thats one way to go about it.  One of our secondary automodes is kind of like that.
So is there a way to 'wait' while still having interrupts going? this would be the easiest way to write a Autonomous Script. You know, Left=255;Right=255;Wait(600);.
Regarding the issue of goaltending while removing the doubler ball....

Remember what goaltending commonly means.  In the basketball sense, it means **interfering with a ball that would have otherwise gone in**.  If a robot is hit with a 5 pt ball when in the process of removing the 2X ball, I would suggest that should not be goaltending.  If the robot had not been there, the 2X ball would still be in place and the 5 pt ball would not have been able to score.

Capping however is just the opposite.  If you are placing the 2X ball and are hit with a 5 pt ball, that may or may not be goaltending, depending on whether the 5 pt ball would have gone in if the robot was not there.

Think of this in a similar fashion as the hanging ruling.  That is, if the vertical bar was not present, would the robot still be hanging?


We are wanting to speak with the Gila Monsters about a potential field trip to the GM Proving grounds on the tenth of March for team 998 of Soldotna Alaska. If they could help us arange this for our day of free time we would appriciate it greatly.

Thank You,

Go through Kevin's code and check *very carefully* what goes where. I'd replace them with aliases, if he hasn't yet.

I, personnally, wouldn't have just replaced the file. Just copy/paste everything. That way, I know what's going in.
sry about that, perhaps I was unclear - essentially, MCC18 casts any constant from 0-255 as a unsigned char, so you may want to cast the constants as well.
A few more **scenes**?? you mean you've gotta create all of the objects, environment, textures, etc., and animate whatever characters you have in it? Good luck, I hope you finish it. Just remember to leave enough time to render (and upload).

we are usign the van door motor, with a very unique way of pullign us up. we are suign 2 mechanisms, one is a ball screw($400 unit, thanks NOOK for the free screw  :D  :D  :D  ) and that drives up 1 section, that causes a system of cables to move, causign anuther part to extend, witch dose the same thign, causing another to extend. we are usign an electronic sprign pin system to hold it up after the power is cut(an idea to use a spinnign fly wheel to power it, but too heavy)

evryone seems to be usign winches.....not a winch or a chain on the whole thing
Yes, could you please post some video for download, I would love to see our robot in action from a different view. (when it actually was in action :ahh: )
We'd love to get a 32 player flight mini-tourney going... or as I suggested a 64 player Massively Multiplayer battle  :D
We're using Window motors to lift the arm up and down and a smaller motor (van door maybe?) to release the hook. The arm then muscles up using the window motor. It's efficiant and not very heavy. Today was a scrimage and we hanged very well. Other teams had problems or were too slow. However 343 was quite good at it as well. And another one I can't recall wasn't bad either. :)
i liked when our arms well apart/off.. i would love to see that again!
Ditto on the ticklish guys thing, but also it helps majorly if it's a female doing it. Otherwise I hate it.


We rendered everything in .mov and then transfered via pen drive to an ibook and used imovie to compile everthing.  Worked pretty good.




From my experience, iMovie isn't able to import quicktime files (not iMovie 2, at least) what version of iMovie are you using?

The 2.4 GHz wireless video works great in my home... if I unplug my 2.4 GHz telephone... and my 802.11b wireless LAN...

But then is is really great!  I purchased the 2.4 GHz stereo A/V sender/receiver from:

http://www.discreet-surveillance.com/24mhz_transmitter.cfm#

A bit pricey, but very usefull.  I use a high-res B/W camera that gives a very sharp picture.

One problem is that wireless LAN, bluetooth and cordless phones operate on 2.4 GHz.  However it's not really a problem as long as your reciever is not near one of these devices.  If the robot is closer than the interfering device, then you should be fine.  It is still sensitive to reflections and when the robot is driving around you will get some breakups.  Maybe 1.2 or 1.7 GHz would be better?

My TX operates on 4 channels, 3 of which are in the Amateur Radio band, but with low enough power that you don't need a license.  I plan to increase my TX output in the amateur band from 100 mW to 1 W or more, but then it may knock out the wireless LANs at the competition.

For even more fun, I used two servos to control the pan/tilt of the camera with a joystick... We can look down into the robot to see mechanisms working, and then tilt up to see where we are going.

It's a big hit with the students to have a "robot" view.  At our open house this weekend we plan to project the "robot cam" up on a wall for the spectators to see... Anything to generate more interest in FIRST.
My team chose to use the seat motor with a 2:1 gear reduction, works perfectly, a little slow though, but it's not comin down after we're up there  :)



My other question is if we can exclude some parts of firsts code, like the printf library since they take up a large chunk of the program flash memory and I want to use that space for other stuff.
Thanks,

Yea.  You can scrap alot more than jsut the printf lib.  The first thing we did was gut the default code.  I don't remember the exact amount of memory e saved, but we were able to shave off over about 20% of the code.  Besides, printf, two other good places that have a lot of room for a diet are userroutines.c and ifi_utilities.c.  It is also a good idea to turn on certian compilar optimizations.  You would be surprised how much those can save you in some cases.  If you don't understand the memory allocation, then it would be a good idea to read up on that, because it will allow you to write better code.  The compiler manual is the best resource for that, although i think it kinda sucks.
i love the matrix theme..very good job.

Oops sorry.
I meant to *finish* . We have almost all of the essentials and are mostly working out the bugs and such. I am confident all will turn out well.
The first picture shows the motors (I drew in arrows to show you which two out of the three drive the bar) and the othe picture kind of shows you the pully system on the bar (its the best picture I have at the moment or the system).

The last time we had a [Mac vs. PC debate](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=14125), things got kind of heated.

Some things to help keep this going smoothly ...

Posting "I hate ____ just because it really sucks" or "_____ is SO much better because I said so." or even "_____ is WAY better because my cousin's best friend's sister works for that company and we get free computers. So that's why." is just going to start fights and flame-wars ... try to keep responses to something more like, "I prefer ____ because the blah blah blah blah seems to be better than the other. It's more compatible with blah blah blah ... " etc, etc.

If you disagree with a point someone else has made, saying, "NO! You're totally wrong!! ____ is way better just because it is!" isn't going to help anything. Defending a counterpoint works so much better.

Lastly, if you don't have something reasonable to say, just don't say anything at all.  :p

Let's see if we can do this without having to lock this thread.  :)

2 Drill motor drive and 2 fisher price motor winch. No pneumatics




Well, we changed to a van door motor winch, and are using a fisher price motor for another task.
We press them off using an arbor press and two 1/4 in steel plates that we have milled down a sort of pocket into right at the crack between the plates -- they kind of fit like a collar around the shaft between the motor housing and the gear.

Works great.

looks heavy



It's actually not that bad, keep in mind the size of the gearbox in relation to the Drill Motor in the picture and that all of the 20 pitch gears are lightened.  The last stage (Far Bottom) is held in with Tran-Torques, the rest are all welded.
This thing makes quite a whine at full speed, which by the way is right around the same as last years.  FAST!
if your not a fan of bulky code:

relay8_fwd = !rc_dig_in18;
relay8_rev = 0;

from there, the RC has a built in pull up on the (s) line. soo you connect the white to one side of the switch and the black to the otherside of the switch. that is, if your using a pwm style color coded cable. you dont need the positive at all. the pressure switch is N.C. meening that with this setup the normal signal will be 0 and when it closes it will be 1. therefore !rc_dig_in18 yeilds 1 when it is normal and 0 when it goes over. no if statment needed.
For 200, the world's highest waterfall.
Alot of people seem to forget that you can use any motor depending on how you gear it.  Alot of people also seem to forget that you don't have to lift yourself 9ft in the air.  a cm or so will do.  Why does speed really matter in this case.  If you can lift yourself 1 cm in a few secs why does it matter as long as you are hanging.  Perhaps i am missing somethign here.
I know that it does not provide info on all of the games but there is so much more that is there.

bulky? I was just trying to keep it simple. . .   :(
wow, 25lbs robot weight limit in 1992, I don't even think thats possible to get a running robot under 25lbs today
we are using the same vandoor motor that lifts our arm to lift the bot. it can pull the robot ALL the way up, but we probably wont. its a pretty powerfull little motor
gj ryan as usual :D i liked seeing our logo involved in such a well done animation
i must say it's kind of an interesting way to travel--- but it could work

have fun building y'all
hmmm.....the tiger bunnies are hanging......i wonder if anyone else wants to know what the rest of the bot looks like....i will be taking bribes and i will give fair warning that 340 will be a fiece competitor this year






























cough you will see this bot from far away cough
every "if" statment is at least 4 lines in ASM. add an "else" and that adds 6 more lines. a boolean assinment is only 2 lines. but whatever
Kick a** animation Ryan, wouldn't expect any less from you.
Very origional, could very well be an award winner (ill vote ofr ya at MR if you submit there).
Thanks for putting me in the credits, I still can't believe you did that  :yikes: .
oh not possible is it??!! I will make one... all i need is duct tape and a high powered hole saw...
The one in DC went well, except for the radio channel problem. They had to be set manually, and some couldn't get off the default channel.

There were at least two that did the big ball, and two that did the chinup. Here we are:[http://www.mbhs.edu/~aajohnso/robo04/PlayDay/DSC01171%20(Medium).JPG](http://www.mbhs.edu/~aajohnso/robo04/PlayDay/DSC01171%20(Medium).JPG)
(bad lighting, fuzzy, but that is 449 haning)

We were able to just drive up the 6" step, but we also drive up balls, goals, robots, etc, so we need to do something about that (we came home and started fabricating). There was some big event there, which first was a small part of, so there wasnt much room and a lot of people.
we only had a few tapes and two cameras when we were filming, so we had to keep switching between cameras and tapes.  when one tape ran out, we would switch to the other camera, rewind the tape, and switch back when the other tape ran out.  in other words, we recorded over some of the earlier matches... :(

-but- we do have the tapes as they were last used, which is probably...the last seeding matches, the alliances pickings, and the semis/finals.  there's no guarantee, but i can try to get something up with whatever we have, sometime soon. then ya'll can see yourselves in acton, at least a little bit!   :D

right now we -do- have pictures up!  go to [www.shsrobotics.org](http://www.shsrobotics.org) and click the link on the homepage... ;)
you could try lowering the voltage programmaticaly, or add lots and lots of cooling...


Do you have a smaller version? 30 kb down isn't exactly speedy.




We will be providing one in the very near future.  We will inform you once that has been done.
Do you think its a voltage problem? We are only using two drivetrain motors and two window motors.

Thanks
I claim no expertise when dealing with motors, but you're going to be blowing fuses when the motor draws too much current, meaning when it's trying to handle a large load. Is your bot too heavy? Is the gear ratio okay? Friction problems?
well how are youu driving? are you sure there is not too much friction on the wheels? does the main drive shaft drive freely when it is off the ground? what type of wheels/treads are you using?
There are lots of factors involved that may affect your drive.  Here is a thread that addresses several possible causes:

[http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25589](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25589)

If you have any specific question be sure to ask some of the respondees to this thread like Al and Joe.  They have lots of experience and are good about giving responses that might help.


From page 3 of the latest team update(#12):
"balls will be inflated at each site to their stated 13" dimension measured at their Equator(the manufacturing seam of the ball). Since misshapen balls are expected, they are considered to be part of the game challenge."



I was really happy to see this move to a lower dimensional measurement of the balls.

In the past, FIRST has tried to define the ball in 3D -- this is a very difficult field measurement to make.  The equator definition is good but it still assumes a round cross section at the equator and requires a template.

To be perfectly happy, I would only love to see this rule regarding ball size in future rules:


>   FIRST makes no assurances concerning the balls. Balls are not perfect spheres.  They vary in size and shape and texture.  If your team as adversely affected by a ball that is out of round or oversize or undersize or slippery, we are sorry, but that is how the ball bounces...
>
> ...concerning size of roundish balls, FIRST will have a target circumferance of the balls measured around the equator (the seam of the ball left from the molding process) of (13*pi) = 40.8 inches.  We expect, but do not guarrantee this measurement will vary between (12*pi) = 37.7" and (14*pi) = 44".  FIRST will us a string marked with the appropriate lengths as a measurement gauge.
>


The advantage of such a rule is that it makes clear that FIRST is not going to be the "ball police" making sure every ball is EXACTLY as spec'ed and the gauge fits in your pocket.

8 wheel drive!
direct drive from the CIMs is definitely not going to work, they don't have enough torque straight out.  What would really help is a description of your drivetrain.  What gearing are you using?  What size wheels?  Are you sure there isn't any binding in the drivetrain somewhere?

That was my first assumption about what was wrong with your drill motor drivetrain, as metal shavings shorting the motor would mostly completely kill it, not kill it after 10 feet.



Use big ball.  I only saw 2 teams do it succesfully, only 1 of them more than once.





Was that us.. because we did a couple times in practice rounds.. but then in the finals we kept losing pneumatic pressure and out main arm gear down sprocket broke in half  :mad: Well anyway we were team 195... "The Ghetto Bot" (the one with PVC arms, orange gloves, and a zip tied on sign from our pits at nats)
Ok this is great and all, but what did you you learn about the dynamics of the game?  Not to whine, but this thread has gotten a bit of topic, and us teams who weren't able to make it to a practice scrimish would really like some insight into things.

How big of a hazard were the small balls?
How did autonomous go?
How much contact was there?
What strategies were sucessful?
What strategies weren't?
Was hanging big?
How important were the smalls balls and the big balls?
What sorts of mehcanisms proved effective and inneffective?
What were the common characteristics of high scorign robots?
What were the biggest challenges for most bots?
How important was speed?  Torque? Control?
Were alot of people able to get up the ramp?
.......... etc, etc, etc.....
We dont have any problems whatsoever as long as the bot is off of the ground. We are using the standard wheelchair wheels in the back and caster in the front. Our bot weoghts about 75-80 pounds. We are also assuming that the motors are encountering either friction/resistance from somewhere and that is what is overloading the circuit.

One question that we do have is:

Are the CIM motors as good as the drill motors? We seem to get much more power out of the CIMs that we did the drills, but that all depends on the gearbox, of course. We plan to continue with the CIMs as long as we can track down the fuse problem.

Thanks

Team 1380
ok pretty much what it came down to was....

1) Gathering balls takes too much time and proved not to be worth it
2)who ever hangs wins

then again, most teams didnt have new bots or didnt have their new ones worked out, so we still have to wait and see
I personally prefer Macs, although I use PCs as well (and more obscure systems too). My computer collection at the moment consists of an iMac G4 (the flat panel :)), an iBook, and an IBM server-class Pentium pro machine. I use all three, but the iMac primarily. Mac OS X 10.3 is a solid operating system that I've found to be much more secure and easy to use than any Windows box I've used. Yes, Windows has come a long way, but I think it still has a ways to go.

Other operating systems I'm used to include Solaris - which takes the power underlying Mac OS X (UNIX), and marries it in this case under CDE for a GUI that is so-so. So there's my stance :)

I've used Macs since System 6 (early '90s), and Windows since 3.11 for Workgroups. Solaris is recent :)
Nevermind, I deleted that post (in case someone was wondering) If you download it off Streamline it goes much faster, heh.
I have found that if you throw it soccer style the ball has a tendency to slip through the backposts on the stationary goal. Today at the UTC scrimmage seems like most people are throwing bastketball style and its working fine
Thank you for all the compliments! Indeed a smaller file size will be offered soon, so for those that don't have high speed internet - don't fret, you'll see it soon :)

Thanks again guys  :]
the cims are reliable they have been our drivetrain motors for the past 3 years, but the drills our also good well really depends how much torque and speed you want
are you running the CIM's into the drill motor gearbox?! This will give a speed that is insanely high and far less torque
Oh I have high speed internet (Two seperate companies actually), I just wanted to wait 20 minutes instead of 30  :yikes:
At DC I pretty much got the impression that the balls are actually very small, cuddly landmines. When all of them are dumped, all hell breaks loose on the playing field. It doesn't matter if you have a little ground clearance or a lot of ground clearance, you start riding up on balls simply because they're so grippy on aluminum. Teams were being dissuaded from hanging or grabbing yellow balls simply because a little red ball was smack dab in their way. This has gotten so bad that I've told my autonomous guys to work out a "ball-bocker" program that doesn't allow the bonus point balls to be hit!

Hanging looks to be the major issue. Teams simply couldn't pick up the yellow multiplier balls (thought that has to do with the fact that the balls weren't exactly to spec), and very few could hang. Those that could hang generally went from the very top platform. Very few teams at DC were doing much of anything.

Nobody at DC had an autonomous, and it didn't seem to matter.
Just one question, why do you have the Spaceship Earth with the 2000 hand on it on the animation page?

Oh, and good animation.
We are using the standard gearbox configuration that is included in the kit. Since we are a rookie team, we started with what we had. I am afraid that we may have a little binding within the frame. I have attached a picture from about three weeks ago so you can see the setup.

Thanks<br><br>![Picture 050.jpg|406x322](upload://nVgztf3MtBMT2a4S9zAhTmEkjlD.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![Picture 050.jpg|406x322](upload://nVgztf3MtBMT2a4S9zAhTmEkjlD.jpeg.jpeg)<br>
Solid work. Nicely done.
What do you mean by power?  The CIMs and drills are pretty much equal in power.  If you're talking about how fast the wheels turn, that could be the entire problem.  The CIMs free speed is 5500 rpm.  if you guesstimate 2500 under load driving your robot, and the 12.5" wheels, then you need atleast a 10:1 gear reduction for them to be able to push your robot.

Edit:
Tomman has a good question.  are you running the CIMs straight into that gearbox?  if so, they won't provide nearly enough torque as that is only a 2:1 reduction.


Just one question, why do you have the Spaceship Earth with the 2000 hand on it on the animation page?

Oh, and good animation.




I'm not sure about the Epcot thing, I'll consult the web team and get back to you within 3-5 business days.

And thank you  :]
oh wow, i just stumbled on this thread, i'm glad to hear you're ok! see you at nats!


I noticed the AMD vs. Intel debate spinning off this way, so let's start this up: Which do you perfer: PC or Mac? Personally I love PC and hate mac with a passion.




This subject done many, many before times.  If this thread does get out of hand, it will be closed promptly.
can you give a more exact description of your drivetrain?  What gear ratios do you have?  What are you using to acheive these gear ratios?  Is there any misalignment anywhere?  Your explanation is a little confusing?

Oh and btw to answer your question about drills vs. chips, they both have their place.  The drills are i believe slightly more powerful than the chips.  The drills have a much higher free speed and a much lower torque output.  The chips have much higher torque and much lower speed. The CIMs are much more reliable and durable than the drills.
How did autonomous go?
Although some teams had a semi-working autonomous mode, most didn't have anything yet.

How much contact was there?
meh, not too much, especially compared to previous years.

What strategies were sucessful?
if you can shoot, and you can hang, you can win.

What strategies weren't?
pushing balls wasn't as big as I though it would be.

Was hanging big?
Oh yeah. When my team hung, we won (haighest score of the day! w00t!). Those 50 points add up.

How important were the smalls balls and the big balls?
Not as much as I thought, but still very important, particularly the small.

What sorts of mehcanisms proved effective and inneffective?
lots of the big ball grabbers weren't working right (ours wasn't even attached yet) however I think it'll have to wait until the first regionals.

What were the common characteristics of high scorign robots?
hang, climb, and not break.

What were the biggest challenges for most bots?
Getting the robot to work. Not many autonomous modes worked, and there was a lot of unfinished robots.

How important was speed? Torque? Control?
I guess it all depends on the strategy involved. Balls were everywhere, so speed wasn't a big deal there because you didn't really have to fight for them. Most robots kept to their own side.

Were alot of people able to get up the ramp?
I didn't see that many doing it.


One thing that I noticed that was majorly different from last year was the penalty system. It killed a lot of teams (we were penalized for part of our robot entering the corral, buzz had part of its bot out of the field and was penalized, lots of teams got into some trouble)




My team will be putting up information for individual teams (with their permission, of course) that we gathered at the scrimmage on our website (http://www.team96.org is the main site, and out scouting database is http://www.team96.org/scouting/) and some teams have already registered and put their information up themselves. It;ll give you a better idea about what other teams are doing.
I do apologize for my lack of knowledge in the subject area, but as I mentioned we are a rookie team and are unexpereinced in these areas. We are using the standard gear boxes, the large gear amd the small gear and thats it. The lasgre gear is in on the output shaft and the smaller gear is on the wheel shaft. All of these came in our kit. We havent riiged any special gearings or customizations.

Thanks
Another thought.  If the drivetrain was working ok with the drills, why don't you try testing the drills outside the robot and such?  If you think it's a problem with the motors themselves, there are several atlanta teams.  try to get in touch with them and borrow their drills if they're not using them.

If you're using the gears (they have diagonal teeth) with the CIMs, then they aren't being geared down enough to work.  The CIMs look like they're designed to work using the sprockets, chains, and 6" wheels.  If you want to use the CIMs you'll have to completely change out your drive system.
Thank you for all your kind praise :) In comparison to last year's animation, I feel like we've come a long way.  Also, cudos to Charlie Moorhead and Mike Neely for, the other animators on our team because it wouldn't have turned out the way it did w/out you guys.  Same to Jason Hoff for the great editing.

See you guys at Arizona and Midwest  :]
We dont necessaryilt think of it as being the motors themeselves because the bot runs fine off of the ground with either motor. We were just trying to problem solve with the CIMs and we thought that we were well ont he way, untilwe put the bot back on the ground.
We had a problem with one of the plastic motor mounts breaking. This was just in assembling the robot together. Hope they last through competitions.
next chance you get, run the motors with the bot off the ground.  if you can stop the wheel from turning with one hand, then it's not putting out enough torque


Has anyone else had problems with the gearbox plates breaking? We noticed that the gear and spacers were too big, and when we tighten the bolts it bends the plastic. We broke both of ours at the practice today. We replaced them w/spares and added aluminum plates to hold it together, but i wanted to know if anyone else has had this problem.

[http://www.mbhs.edu/~aajohnso/robo04/PlayDay/DSC01175%20(Medium).JPG](http://www.mbhs.edu/~aajohnso/robo04/PlayDay/DSC01175%20(Medium).JPG)




We had that problem last year. We went through about 6 sets of gearbox before the season was over. The gearboxes are not very strong and if the spacers are not exactly right, they will break.



See you guys at Arizona and Midwest  :]



Don't forget about Atlanta!  :ahh:
There is a simulator part of the full C compiler that FIRST sent. It will allow you to input values for each port and register.


Was that us.. because we did a couple times in practice rounds.. but then in the finals we kept losing pneumatic pressure and out main arm gear down sprocket broke in half




No, sorry.  I didn't see the practice rounds.  I showed up at about 1pm.  Team 839 did it a couple times, and buzz (175) did it once.

**How did autonomous go?**
Seems like most teams were making sure they could move in auto mode.  Not much was programed.  Buzz went forward a little and spun once.  Other teams went forward also.
**How much contact was there?**
The contact happened when another team was blocking ball chutes, or keeping another bot from getting on top of the platform.   Not nearly as much contact as the previous 2 years.
**What strategies were sucessful?**
One bot corals small balls, while the other hangs.  Or the non-hanger keeps opposing robots from hanging.
**What strategies weren't?**
Well, alot of teams pushed small balls, but not very well.  Very few teams did anything with the large ball.
**Was hanging big?**
The biggest deciding factor.
**How important were the smalls balls and the big balls?**
If you can get 10+ small balls your in good shape to win.  If you can add a large ball to that they you're golden.  A large ball with few small balls may not cut it.
**What sorts of mehcanisms proved effective and inneffective?**
Quality over quantity.  Stick to one task and do it well.  More specificlly for you:  A simple hook to grab the bar works like a charm.  A simple pincher for the large ball works well.
**What were the common characteristics of high scorign robots?**
They could hang.  Or they could *hold* 5+ small balls.
**What were the biggest challenges for most bots?**
Geting up the 6" step.  Alot tried, few succeeded.
**How important was speed? Torque? Control?**
1) Control
2) Speed
3) Torque
**Were alot of people able to get up the ramp?**
By ramp, I assume you mean the tiny stairs.  Only if they're robot was narrow enough to get around the staionary goal.



Hope that answers your questions.
We just tried that and we blew the fuse again. The whole things runs like mad until its put under stress. Based on the past posts, I think that we have a serious problem. We are going to dissasemble our gearboxes and check the driveshaft opening through the frame for any friction that may be occurring. If that doesnt solve the problem then we may drop the current drivedtrain altogether and create a direct drive system with sprockets and chains.

Thanks for the suggestions..any further ones please feel free to post,

Thanks,

I can't find this referenced in the rules this year, but, in the past, reaching over the top has resulted in a DQ.
house
if you're blowing the fuses on the CIMs by stopping it with your hand, then it's not geared down enough, end of story.  That isn't a problem with friction in your drivetrain.  You have 2 options:

1.  Change your drive train to gear the CIMs down more.  You could accomplish this by putting the 10 tooth sprockets on the output of the gears, and the 45 tooth sprocket on the wheels, and then run the chain between them.

2.  Go back to your drills and try to figure out what's wrong with them.
Human player from 521 said i should ask a ref at the comp b4 the match. Or if one would post here :)
The way we lost most of our weight was reducing our robot's two motor drivetrain to single motor drivetrain. This allowed us to take a lot of weight out of our gearboxes. We didn't need the extra motor but it would have been nice.

Another way we took out all that weight was by trying to remove as much steel as possable. For starters we milled down all of out sprockets.

the rest of the weight was lost in drilling holes.
correct me if i am wrong but isn't the code for the pressure switch already in the default as long as you hook up the switch to digital input 18 and the pump to relay 8?

If that happens, you are most likely geared to high for your tire size and the CIMS.  We are using chain to reduce the drill output to approx. 184 rpm for 12 inch tires.  Reduction of 2.3:1.  And that is like 10 ft/s.  Still fairly fast.  The rookie workshop reccomends to be in the range of 8 ft/s.  Your best option would be to figure out if your reduction is right.  The CIMS output 5500 no load and the drills output in the range of 20000 rpm with no transmissions.  You would have to look at the specs for the transmission but low gear, all the way forward, is around 425 rpm and high is 1000+?? something.  This is wear I would re-check figures so you will have enough torque.  There are several good sheets on drivetrains in the white papers, but since you are running short on time I would get in contact with veteran teams around ATL to get some immediate help.  It you find you are in a reasonable range there are other problem such as binding or problem with current (I doubt it would be this unless you are just running a low battery).  Good luck and continue to ask questions.
Check your pwms first.  We had some unconnected and got blinking victors a couple days ago.  Other than that just test different things changing them one at a time scientific like.  One variable at a time.  We've had bad victors before too so if you have spares you could wire one up and test it to see if the victor is the problem but just stick to one variable.
I would say it would be the same as reaching outside the ball corral.  Remember there are tall robots this year and the plexiglass is only 7 feet tall.  Pinched fingers.  Ouch.. In the matter of safety I would say "Please keep all hands and feet within the player stations at all time.  They did say you could dqed for leaving the player area. And your arms are part of yourself.  At least I want to keep it that way.
On the matter or PWMs, we have tested and retested the 3 PWMs we are using and immediately, when we change the PWM connections between the 2 bad victors and the 1 good one, the PWM that is connected to the good victor works.  We have been trying to reprogram it for about 2 of the three hours, thinking it was a programming error, but when we loaded the original FIRST program it did not work either.  Thank you for your suggestion though.
Team 992
thanx a bunch for your quick responces


correct me if i am wrong but isn't the code for the pressure switch already in the default as long as you hook up the switch to digital input 18 and the pump to relay 8?




Yes. The default code contains the following lines, I believe:



relay8_fwd = !rc_dig_in18;
relay8_rev = 0;



Connect the pressure switch to the white and black wires of a cable plugged into digital input 18, and you should be all set (assuming you've connected the compressor's relay to relay output 8).
one quick troubleshoot after youcheck your pwm wires is to just hook the non working victor PWMs to the PWM header you have the working victor on.  If they're still broken then it's a decent bet that there's something wrong with the victors.  if they suddenly work, then there's something wrong in your code.
On reading your response, we have been testing the bad victors in the good PWM slots.  There is still no response.  We are taking our one remaining, new victor and using it to see whether or not it is a victor problem. Thank you for your suggestion.

LOL, u didn't tell the whole story! About you being cocky and all talkin about how you could do it, then burning holes and stuff. Yeah, that was great. LOL, it was a blast...can't wait to beat you at the Chatsworth Scrimmage. Yeah, you heard me right, BEAT YOU. LOL :p

No probem, our facility is free to anyone who needs help with anything, field, programming, robot in general. SpaceOsc, or anyone else that is interested, come on down. We are always here with open arms. And always enjoy the company! Just PM me and I will give you directions.
Take a look at G09.

Reaching over would be reaching into the field.  You may want to try letting the balls roll over the edge, as long as your fingers don't break the plane of the wall.


I have found that if you throw it soccer style the ball has a tendency to slip through the backposts on the stationary goal. Today at the UTC scrimmage seems like most people are throwing bastketball style and its working fine





Today I was messing around and I prefer soccer style on empty stationary goals but on a full goal a single bounce method is superior.  You can get at least 2 more ball in the goal than soccer style.  I need more height to work with though.  If that ceiling wasn't there I would assume basketball shot would work good for the empty goal but I still like the bouncing method to finish out the goal.  But your doing really good if you have to do that.  15+ balls.  By what scrimmage people are saying, that will be hard.
In DC we didn't keep score....it was just 5 min practices in front of the huge crowd at the Engineering Week festivites in the National Building Museum

*None of us had effective autonomous (we're working on it tomorrow!)

*The red balls were a problem..........even a movable GOAL got up on one!

*Since it was practice rather than matches -- there wasn't really any game strategy revealed.....everyone was just troubleshooting their own bots.

aight.. i don't really want to disclose all our information, but we're using a combo of 3 motors to hang. two were designed to multitask performing another function then getting us up there, and the third is our winch (window). All i can say is it takes us a second to get up there- literally. and not just on the platform or steps too :P (i actually shot something through the ceiling when i misgeared a motor)
Hey Joe,
Thanks for the thanks I'm sure any other vet team would do the same.  At least I would hope so.  After you left we got to thinking...  We have a couple of fully functioning parts (appendeges) that we are not using that could be modified to fit your bot and probably help you out We can help you work on them if you want.  Just let me know.
Good luck
Have you gotten it to work and climb the platform yet?


and not just on the platform or steps too




You got my attention.  I want to know more. I guess I will just have to wait.  Such a teaser of a statement.  I've been wanting to see who would take the challenge of lifting themselves without being on the platform or first step.
Update on electrical problems: After using the brand new victor, we have discovered that the problem we are having is within the wiring of the bot.  We have a direct connection from the maxi block to the victors, and now know that the problem is contained in between those wires.  For anyone that is reading this thread, what would be the best way to solve our wiring problem, with the last result being to take the entire system off and reinstalling. Thank you for reading and we look forward to hearing your suggestions.

the function generate_pwms().  Something about pwms13-16 is strange and you have to run them through the function generate_Pwms() (or something like that) to have them run correctly (i think it has to do w/ timing and they way some of the outputs are on the chip).  all in all, i just avoid 13-16, and try to stick to 1-12.

at quincy today... i still have not seen the potential of either shot or its advantages or disadvantages... they were all "heavy" non offical balls, and A LOT of them were going straight throught the back... and that has never happend on our own teams field with the lighter ball and the pvc is A LOT looser on our field also then it was at quincy... from the "human player showdown" we had, our team 121 won w/ 16/20... 2 HP's both got 10 shots one from each side... i went second and used the soccer throw... i was surprised only 1 went through the back when the goal was more full... and one popped out that was hanging on the edge between the PVC... we also figured that it can fit 18 balls comfortably w/o capping it
i'll ask my mentors if I can upload a picture of it tomorrow... even a short movie to accompany it..

[edit] hint: think Diablo 2002 or Beatty/Brazilian Machine 2003 [/edit]
When I render dv/dvcpro quicktime in premiere I get bad artifacts and when I use Cinepak I get nasty pixelation.  So, I tried rendering high quality mpeg4 then I went into 3dsmax and used Videopost to render it into a dv/dvcpro-ntsc format, everything looked clear, but there were digital looking artifacts everywhere.
from what i understand your fingertips can not go past the plexiglass over the top of it =D
Since you now know where the problem is-- get a multimeter and check to make sure the wire is good. Pull on the connectors to see if they are loose. If you have spare wire, make new wires and just run them to see if the victors work.

Check your robot to see if there is bare metal touching the wire. The robot could be grounding out.

Finally, are the fuses for the maxiblock in all the way? Give them a firm push. Let us know if any of this worked
Team 360 will be submitting at the PNW.


i'll ask my mentors if I can upload a picture of it tomorrow... even a short movie to accompany it..




If not upload, I could make a PM trade on the agreement no one else would see.  You wouldn't have a chance to see our bot til championships and I would still like to see how it works.  I don't have team permission to upload pictures even though I think we should.  But I can make private trades.  I know it seems sneaky but I have no say.


Regarding the issue of goaltending while removing the doubler ball....

Remember what goaltending commonly means.  In the basketball sense, it means **interfering with a ball that would have otherwise gone in**.  If a robot is hit with a 5 pt ball when in the process of removing the 2X ball, I would suggest that should not be goaltending.  If the robot had not been there, the 2X ball would still be in place and the 5 pt ball would not have been able to score.

Capping however is just the opposite.  If you are placing the 2X ball and are hit with a 5 pt ball, that may or may not be goaltending, depending on whether the 5 pt ball would have gone in if the robot was not there.





Good point about the fact that the 2x ball would still be in the goal, therefore, should it be considered goaltending.  I'm pretty sure that the Q/A answer said that unintentional goaltending, including capping and uncapping, will be considered goaltending.
HOWEVER, after doing some human player testing the past few days, it ***is*** still possible to score the small balls in a goal even if there is a 2x ball on top.  It's not easy if the poles are spread out, but it's still possible.  So taking that into account, I think regardless, they would count it goaltending if the small ball comes anywhere close to going in the goal (stationary or mobile) - and you have your robot arm attached to the 2x ball.  I suppose if you're poised ready to grab it, but not yet in the way of a shooter to interfere, that would not be goaltending...
Thats a lot of work to completely switch chain types but if you have to do it, do it. Other options include cutting down the hubs of large steel sprockets, drilling holes in them and that route. I would stay away from plastic roller chain. Chain comes under a lot more force than you would think. i mean hundreds and hundreds of lbs of force. I'd do some calculations before you do anything radical like that. just as a headsup normal steel roller chain has a tensil strength of about 1050 lbs.

~Ian
ok... i jujst thought of this... IF the 2x ball is capped... and a robot goes up to try to take it out from the FRONT of the stationary goal, and when its arm is going up, and a HP has the acuracy to hit the robots arm... will it be goaltending... BECAUSE the 2x is still in the goal, its almost IMPOSSIBLE to score more small balls on top of it... so anyone have a clue on the ruling here!?! lol
mmmmmmmmm... Zip Ties ;-)

my opinion...I would still say goaltending.  You did say it was ALMOST impossible.. which means, it's still possible to make the goal.  If there's any possibility at all that the ball could have gone in, then they should call it goaltending.
I'd say this ruling is on the refs.  It could be different from regional to regional and it might not always be perfect, definitely in the eyes of 2 teams.  If you've watched basketball fouls are called by the ref's discretion and I think this is the case in the game this year.  You will just have to live with the ref's decisions..They are only human. (has an idea)-- Robotic refs for a robotic competition, think of the chaos.

I am very interested in small ball handling 'bots. How did they do? How did they do it? Were there any notable ball handling 'bots?

Also, out of curoisity, did any teams have a good way of getting the yellow balls on to the field instead of just nocking them off the tee?

-Andy A.


...I know people have already used these and I ask that the wiring diagram be posted. The spec sheet is not of much help. Judging by the volt meter, it is a simple switch, but the spec sheet for a similar encoder says that it is a digital switch with an internal pull up resistor? I sincerely appreciate any help trying to wire these beasts.




First off CTS CT3003-ND is a Digi-key item number, not the actual part number.  I knew what you were talking about though, bc i'm just that nerdy and memorized the the entire digi-key catalog and all the part numbers.  (actually they just all end in "-ND") :)  288T232R162A1 is the actual CTS part number.

Anyway, this particular part is nothign more than a mechanical switch that contains no circuitty.  Most encoders are a bit higher end than this and their working are a bit more complex.  I'm too lazy to explain that though unless your really curious about it.  As far as wiring it goes, its pretty straight forward.  I'm not sure exectly which pin is which but basically you have a common pin and a bunch of other pins.  Connect the common pin to the "+5v" pin of one of the digital inputs.  Connect each of the rest of the pins to "sig" pins.  For details on the pattern it outputs see: http://rocky.digikey.com/WebLib/CTS/Web%20Data/288%20Series.pdf

The encoders you chose arn't really meant for this sort of use, but i guess they will work.  They are actually meant for light duty human interface applications such as VCR controls and stuff liek that.

Not a problem, Holly.  We had this grand plan to build a second robot, but it has not come together (yet)... so we have a second controller to spare.  We're glad to be able to help out.

I went back to my finished scene with the storyboard and applied toon materials too my scene  :)

That is freakin hillarrious....good job! :D  because it's like an anti story board...you do the animation to make the story board...its soooo funny....laughing...maybe i need more sleep

hopefully if everything goes correctly, we might have a waypointing system that we can change directly before the match using a GUI and selecting a path and having it write the code....but.... we may not have time to finish it.
Check [this paper](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=150) in the White Papers section.  It is a photo walk-through of the disassembly of the Bosch 3360 Gearbox.  It will show you the parts that have to be modified to solve your problem.

In my opinion cutting down hubs s more work than changing chains of equal pitch!
Wow Andy,
That's great of your team to do that.  It seems the Kats are always showing us what FIRST is really all about.  Good luck to you this year!
I suppose a lot of that depends on whether or not you made the MIDI files yourself.  That is the interpretation many people are taking on the rules.

Sometimes I feel the AVA rules are far too vague...
Okay, well back to my question and problem

We have a wench style system, with a van door motor driving the pivot arm and a fisher price motor with the plastic gearbox to drive the wench.  When we attempted to pull using only the wench we were able to get half of the base off the ground before the motor started smoking, and we do not currently have a locking system of any sort to keep it suspended in the air.

We tried using the window motor to hoise ourselves with the pivot but that did not work either.

I believe we are making a different size wench and probably switching the fisher price motor.

If you ahve any more comments, suggestions, or questions i'd appreciate it with the crunch on time.
lol, i have no idea.  :cool:
Have you had any problems with 4-wheeel drive with those tires?  I saw several systems at the DC scrimmage earlier today with similar drive set-ups, that were learning to "dance" as the high-friction tires tried to scrub sideways on the carpet while doing point turns.  Teams were learning very quickly that the tires behave VERY differently on carpet vs. hard floors, as they were seeing a real competition environment for the first time.  Have you had a similar experience?

-dave
Yes, it is offical, much like teams #60 and #254 collaborated on their design this year, teams #1098 and #870 are collaborating on an animation.

Many of you know from this post, Matt decided to not complete his animation this year because it was not up to his standard. Me and him have been chatting ever since he asked advice on audio to use for the animation, and have developed what I would say, is quite a unique friendship. Because of this, I'm fully behind in supporting him on his decision to release his animation next year. Not only that, but I will be collaborating with him to make his vision a reality.

We will be working together on a daily basis to create possibly the most visually stunning piece of animation FIRST has ever seen. Not only visually stunning, but we're hoping to create a message that will encourage future participants to join FIRST and have a great time doing it. We have only begun on this collaboration, which will be a year in the making.

We plan on making a 15 minute animation with complete stunning visuals, an amazing score, ear-bursting sound effects, and a message that will hopefully encourage many more students to join FIRST. Of course the actual animation submitted will be in a somewhat commercial format, with the entire 15 minute animation hopefully being shown at Nationals 2005. We will of course, keep you updated, since this is only pre-production  :)
You can reduce the size of your winch.  If you are using the winch with the fisher-price it might not be enough.
i hate to sound stupid but what is dead reckoning


You can't do *absolute* position because there's no indicator for Red/Blue side, you'd have to put a "compass" in the bot. Not that *that's* difficult.




Correct me if I'm wrong, but each beacon sends out a unique time signature. From this you can point each servo at each beacon. Knowing the two angles that the servos form will give you enough information to complete the trapezoid. You have two lengths and two angles. It's too late right now to go into details and it wouldn't give you much of a competetive edge to know where your robot is on the field with absolute position. If so desired I could elaborate more.
Happy Birthday Matt Adams!
We were going to use a big wench to pull us up onto the bar.  But that led to imagining ourselves in scenes from bad English *Robin Hood* movies, and pretending to be brawling Musketeers, and playing Renaissance Faire, and thinking all sorts of bawdy thoughts, and then she got really upset with the whole idea of wearing that silly corseted costume... :)

So instead we got back to working on the robot, and developing a winch system to reel us up off the ground.

(sorry, I just couldn't resist  :) )
Update: just got back from the mall at 9:00 pm central time and went straight to a Halo party in which we also watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The mall was awesome... showed of our "tacky toilet" and raised a ton of moolah $cha-ching$. tomorrow will be even better. we had a little practice test in which I personally broke the robot twice, yes, twice. in about a frame of 1.5 hours. it's after 1:00 am now.  :( tired  :( . although i had some mishaps with the driving, i am a pretty good candidate to run the arm and box.
well that would be about it.

the problem is that the two lengths you know are not necessarily parallel, which is required for a trapezoid. hence the reason one would need a compass.
A few questions:
How effective were wings for aidiing in pushing balls into the corral?
What did bots with many capabilities focus on?
Did people push balls out of the ring on purpose and to what effect?
Were goal grabbers necessary for pulling goals out of corners?
Were robots that were holding a big ball attacked because they were valuble?

I got my manual driving code working pretty well, and it was time to move on to IR tracking. I hooked up beacons and made IR servo trackers, loaded Kevin's tracker code, and it worked! Yay.


Geez, why do people act so suprised when my stuff works :).





So, can someone tell me why changing the motors from 13 and 15 to 10 and 11 changed the behavior from erratic to normal??? What's going on here?


PWMs 13 through 16 are controlled by the user processor. I saw the wacky behavior you described while developing the receiver and tracking code. The problem isn't with my code (as far as I know). The IFI folks know about this and [wrote it up](http://www.innovationfirst.com/firstrobotics/faq/default.asp?Action=Q&ID=80).

Things heard around Montclair Robotic's shop these past few weeks:

"Let's use the Head Mobile!!"

"Hey, those look like cup-holders."

"Can we do that?...(after an loud noise) oh, I guess we can't..."

"You've been at it for an hour!! Here, let me show you how's it's done... where's the hammer??"

"What time is it?? Can I borrow your cell phone?"

"Trust me... pillow foam and elmer's glue will work!"

"Which one is the IR sensor and which one is the beacon?"

"GOJO is awesome!"

I could go on forever but I have to get back to work!
"No, no... the other way!!"

"What was that??... That was cool... do that again!! Where's the camera?"

"What's the url for the usfirst.org website??"

I just thought of these and I posted them before I forget...  OK, now...  where's the Rotozip?


Im having a problem getting the interupts working on the FRC.


The one thing that comes to mind is to make sure that you also set all interrupt inputs as an INPUT (e.g., digital_io_01 = INPUT) while in User_Initialization(). Other than that, can you be more specific when you say they "don't work". If you're really stuck, send me the code and I'll have a look.

**Were alot of people able to get up the ramp?**
By ramp, I assume you mean the tiny stairs. Only if they're robot was narrow enough to get around the staionary goal.



Do you mean to tell me that the teams who got up on the platforms were only the ones who went up the tiny steps and were small enough to go around the stationary goal??  None came in from the sides??

How did the hangers hang???  Did they go up the platform(s) and then hang or just reach in for the bar from the carpeted level?
Motors... Well, since the compressor is defined as a motor, then maybe.
Sort of I guess...:rolleyes:
"Stop sitting on the yellow ball!!... It's not round anymore."

"I'm trying to make it round again..."

We our overweight 131.1 and thats without any skins that are gonna weigh about 5 pounds so we are working on taking out weight right now the answer looks like we are taken off one of the motors



Wow.. what are those skins made out of???  May I suggest just making them out of tin sheet metal??  Those are real light, actually they are so light, that I hung our previous year's skins from that track system in the ceiling (from the tiles) at the HS last weekend to display them and get them off the floor!!
yes. our air compressor has been getting so hot that it will start to shake baddly and so hot that you will burn yourself if you touch it. we have to unplug the fuse after a while.
It's one of those things that puts those little annoying tags on clothing, the tags with the tiny pieces of plastic "things" that hold them on!!!  lol


Nah, it's a zip-tie tightener..
What do i win???
We are currently a bit overweight, but not alarmingly so.  Our problems are primarily with *where* our weight is rather than how much of it there is.

Our center of gravity is much further toward one end of the robot than we anticipated and that's created some problems regarding the operation of our systems.


At our school we have to take a sememester of board drawing before we can go on to the full year of CAD so we can learn what it takes and why you dont want ot make mistakes but any way my favorite drafting qoute by far is my teacher walking up and down the aisles keep says "Remember men, BLACK is BEEEEEEEEEUITFUL"



LOL  I see you learned how to use SolidWorks eh???   lol  I wonder how I knew that??
..The deadline was fast approaching, so the last few day I decided to work like crazy and add that one more feature that was on our "wish list" which was.....
We had problems with ours stalling at 80 Psi or so if it was too overheated, it wouldnt work right until we had given it a half hour or so to cool.

Our solution was that we got a cheap heatsink for a computer and mounted it with zip ties to the top of the compressor (after scraping off the paint and using tons of thermalpaste).
Even without a fan on the heatsink we are yet to have overheating problems :D
Hi all,

We reprogrammed the robot in p-basic.  It took a bit, but we are allright until Tuesday.

Regards,
--M


it may get u slapped



Nah, you just have to learn to have quick reflexes and duck!!  lol  :p
I'm glad things worked out for you!!  That would not be a good thing. Not being able to drive the robot to do some last minute tweaking.


See you at the NJ Regional?
How did you blow your RC? Anyways, I hope you guys can get the RC in time and program C language into it... Good luck!

After using a drillpress

Student #2: Is that drill bit hot?
Me: A bit... Harharhar...
Team 1425 - Wilsonville Robotics
is submitting for the PNW competition Chairman's award
Team 1151 (The Hitchhikers) submitted our Chairmens award for Portland (PNR)

good luck to all!
We broke one of the plates off somehow on our wooden version of our robot, since we have added a part of the supplied rectangular aluminum stock to both sides so that we can tighten it together better without bending the plastic.

Luckily another team gave us their gearbox assemblies since they wern't going to use them.
Our team found a new way of taking weight off ....

Drilling holes in the battery could make the weight difference  :D

One of our team members accidentally drilled up into the bottom of a battery when he was mounting line following sensors on the bottom, luckily it didnt penetrate the battery all the way, so it was a simple silicone fix.
We also broke one of the "C" pieces of the drill mount, but that was probably due to over-tightening.

The aluminum plate looks like it will be strong enough, glad we arent the only ones with this problem.
usually when you work on getting auton to work, you need some quiet time with the bot alone, so you can run it across the field, see what it does, debug your code, make adjustments, try it again

and you cant have other people trying to tweak subsystems while you are doing this - so you end up there late at night when everyone else has gone home

or like today, going in early on sunday morning :c)
water in the lines is not from the compressor being too hot - its from the air being compressed - it causes the moisture in the air to condense out

professional compressors usually have a water trap - a little device that captures the water in a small cup, esp if you are using them for spray painting.
We were having the same problem at Sussex last year. (We broke about 6 of them)

The way to fix this is to put a Plate on the GearBox with a small lip that goes under the gearbox. (We did the exact same last year and never had a problem since then)

If you look at this picture of this years drive. It already has it on :-)

WOW! nice paint job! is that powder coat? it looks like your robot is made of plastic

nice job machining the parts so they look just like giant lego pieces - and where did you get those wheels?

it looks heavy though - are you gonna have to drill MORE holes in it?

also - I like you way you photoshopped the image so it looks like your robot is sitting on a desk :^)
once a second would not be fast enough - the gyros have a bandwidth of 40 Hz - which means it can change values 40 times a second

so if you only read it once a second, you are only seeing 1 out of 40 possible outputs that it is creating each second.

If you want to integrate it to get compass heading, add the value to a integer variable in every pass (loop) of the SW - and make sure you subtract out the zero value (512 if you read it with a 10bit ADC - but you might need to see what the actual 'zero' value is by testing it on your bot).
Well, I would recommend getting a replacement battery if you're using silicone to keep it form leaking, that's just not safe.

Anyway, my team decided to do swiss cheese form the beginning. We don't have a lot of weight issues this year, since we went with aluminum plates instead of extrusion this year (big difference in accessability and weight). Besides that, the only thing we cut down on weight is our towers for the elevators. As soon as we got those, we slapped them on the mill and designed out weight reduction (patterns, and our team number and school name). All in all, it was more succesful this year then previous ones when it comes to weight.
Well, our team is addicted to the trial version of Halo.  You will most likely see at least one computer running it at any given time in the classroom where we build.

That, and we have a bad tendency to raid the teachers lounge on the top floor of the building.  (75-cent cokes...mmmmmmm)

And I can't forget about two of the team members insisting that we install an automotive strobe light on the robot.  (The LEDs would still be on there, naturally.)

As for fundraising, we're selling palmetto trees.  Then we've got our auction, which will have all sorts of things, including a wing party from Hooters.  (There was some bickering within the team as to whether or not we should use that for our banquet.  I sided with the majority--to the block it goes!  :D )

Oh, and we're going to count change to load onto the local grocery store's gift cards.  Actually, it's this Saturday at Piggly Wiggly #60 (Lake Murray Blvd.) from noon to four, if anyone from the neighborhood is reading this.

Other than that, we're quite boring.
Last I checked, 1293 is running two motors.  We're going CENSORED on the CENSORED, and for the rest, we're just using CENSORED.  :D

Oddly enough, we've used no less than three different sets of motors for our drivetrain--first the CIM motors, then the drill motors, then we settled on these other ones--I think they're the window motors, but I may be wrong.

(In case you were wondering, pneumatic, arm, and that last one was just for my personal jollies)

Our team reduced weight by removing all comments from code and deleting the 1s from the HEX file. After all, the 0s are just a lot of nothing and comments are completly worthless. ;)

10 lbs over = go on diet. We shead all those lbs then we must have had some Krispy Kreames cause now we are 6 lbs over. Why do these stupid diets work for such a short time. Maybe after running Blizzard 5 around it may shed those lbs. This I doubt so its back on diet.

We were driving the robot around for some testing, and about 3-4 minutes of driving it around on a cement area in the middle of our school, we noticed smoke from the motors. We checked it out and there was definitely smoke coming from the motors and a very strong smell of it. We have one large muffin fan mounted above each drill motor, although we noticed a large amount of escaped airflow, we thought this might be the problem, so today we are going to fabricate some air ducts. Does anyone else have any suggestions? We did not disassemble the motors and I do not believe there was any drilling on the chassis around the motors.

Also, we noticed that there was a lag with one wheel, so it skips three or four times at acceleration and then moves slower than the other wheel as we drive around. I know that the other wheel's gearbox is greased up, and this one's isn't. Does anyone know what else might cause this problem? :confused:

yes actualy, but we are preared for that. We have a set of casters on some pnumatic cylinders that we put down when were on the carpet for better turning. When we climb we go into awd mode, and when we go up those larger steps they assist the back end in getting up.
Our vote is for cutting down sprockets... as long as you have a lathe..
We cut a few holes in our sprockets and turned those big heavy hubs down and literally cut pounds off of our robot...  example
an 18 tooth sprocket weighed 2 lbs when we started and ending up weighing 1 pound   !!!    and that was JUST turning down that thick hub ...
I even did it!!! and I am only a physics teacher!!!

Yeah, you're supposed to do the storyboard before you do the animation... but we never do lol. We may draw a few ideas down but as for a storyboard, we just make rough sketches of what our scene looks like.  :]
BMS Tradesman:  Anthony, take off all of those bolts on the outside, we're goona cut half of the heads off to save weight.
Me:  We're goona...wait, what?!
BMS Tradesman:  Get the inside ones too.
When I left BMS yesterday, we were 1.5 lbs over. We'll get it down to something frighteningly close to 130 lbs, soon, though.

We started shaving off half of the heads on all the bolts on the robot to save weight.  ::sigh::  God I love build season.
We're going with the Chips & Drills on drivetrain, the vanDoor for the winch/armControl (it's mad pimpin), and a seatMotor for the ball grabber.
We might toss on a couple of servos for sensors, but we're not going to have any pneumatics (our newly selected Head of Pneumatics was dissappointed).

Yes, you can used signed ints in your code. We're using a header file with the following types defined in it:



//data type definitions for integers - C18

//uchar
//size:	8 bits (1 byte)
//range: 0 to 255
typedef unsigned char uchar;

//schar
//size: 8 bits (1 byte)
//range: -128 to 127
typedef signed char schar;

//uint16
//size: 16 bits (2 bytes)
//range: 0 to 65535
typedef unsigned int uint16;

//sint16
//size: 16 bits (2 bytes)
//range: -32768 to 32767
typedef signed int sint16;

//uint24
//size: 24 bits (3 bytes)
//range: 0 to 16,777,215
typedef unsigned short long uint24;

//sint24
//size: 24 bits (3 bytes)
//range: -8,388,608 to 8,388,607
typedef signed short long sint24;

//uint32
//size: 32 bits (4 bytes)
//range: 0 to 4,294,967,295
typedef unsigned long uint32;

//sint32
//size: 32 bits (4 bytes)
//range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
typedef signed long sint32;



So, if you want a 4-byte signed integer you can declare it as a sint32. An unsigned 3-byte integer is a uint24, etc.


The neutral position for our joysticks is not 127, and this is making us mess up a bit. For the left side, neutral is 165, and for the right, neutral is 193. What could be causing this, and how do we make it go back to the original 127 position?




I'm assuming since you're including numbers, the problem is the PWMs are neutral (solid yellow) when the values the RC outputs are 165 and 193, respectively - I'm assuming the problem isn't in the calibration of wheel of the joystick.

Sometimes the victors get a little-bit screwey and don't recognize the signal coming out of the RC correctly.  There is a method to calibrate the actual victors.  In page two of the IFI [Victor 884 Users Manual](http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/V883UsersManual.pdf), it has the instructions on what to do to calibrate the victor.  After pressing a few things, you essentially move your joystick to full forward, full back, and the neutral position.  The victor then detects what the signal coming out of the RC is at these positions and adjusts itself appropriately.  Before you do this, though, I recommend you use the calibration wheel on the joystick to make sure when you move the joystick into neutral, the RC sees 127 as coming in.

So is there a way to 'wait' while still having interrupts going? this would be the easiest way to write a Autonomous Script. You know, Left=255;Right=255;Wait(600);.




I'm sorry, but I don't understand what the advantage is of waiting.  Why would you need to pause at a specific instruction for some amount of time?  What would you need to do in auton mode that couldn't be accomplished by having a state where the drive motors are sent neutral values?  You could just be sitting still "waiting" for some input to come your way ... but you don't need to mess with timer's at all.  I just don't see the need, so please explain if I  am mistaken ...
Kinda on a similair topic, how can you create a single-bit variable - kinda like a bool - using c?

[This](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=272) whitepaper says you can use individual bits like so:


struct bits {
unsigned int itsy: 3; // Use 3 bits as the variable ?itsy?
unsigned int bitsy: 3; // Use 3 bits as the variable ?bitsy?
unsigned int teensy: 1; // Use 1 bit as the variable ?teensy?
unsigned int weensey:1 // Use 1 bit at the variable ?weensy?
};


but the "itsey: 3;" syntax doesn't seem to work unless you are using it inside a struct.  I'm sure there's a way more elegant than using a struct, but can anyone let me know what it is?


every "if" statment is at least 4 lines in ASM. add an "else" and that adds 6 more lines. a boolean assinment is only 2 lines. but whatever




There is a difference between it being easy for a human to read, and easy for a computer to understand.

Personally, I choose what is easier for me to understand, and in the 2% of cases where it needs to be fast, I write well commented assembly.

If you're having problems with interrupts, Daniel Katanski of team 240 wrote an amazingly helpful [whitepaper](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=272) on the topic - I recommend you read the whole thing, as not only it explains in details how to use interrupts and timers, but it also gives some neat programming tricks here and there.  I just began using interrupts the other day (after sitting down for a day with that whitepaper and pouring through each line of the default code), so I think other people on this board are going to be more helpful than me in terms of debugging.  However, I do want to include this part from the whitepaper:


>
> When initializing a digital input interrupt there are 5 things that must be done, they are:
> 1. Set the port to be an input (as shown in the code above).
> 2. Set the interrupt on the pin to be a low priority interrupt.
> 3. Set the edge select (rising from 1 to 0, or falling 0 to 1, remember bit values versus voltages).
> 4. Clear the interrupt flag.
> 5. Enable interrupts.


I printed out a copy of that and taped it to the computer monitor.  During my debugging stage, I kept on referring back to there to see what I was forgetting - as a beginer, I found that probably the most important part of the entire whitepaper.  I would also add "Make sure you call ALL of the necessary initialization functions," but you said you already are doing that.

Although it'll take quite a bit of work to incorporate into your code if you built something off the default IFI code, something that you might also wish to  check out is Kevin's [heavily annotated interrupt and timer template code](http://www.kevin.org/frc/frc_interrupts.zip). Kevin - you did a great job with your comments on that one - they helped me a lot.

"Smoke test time!" -refering to when we first power it up after wiring it
Cool, thanks for the fast response
Because the auton. is pretty new, I think it makes sense to say that teams haven't really incorporated the extra time needed to program.  They jam it in late in the building and even during competition.  Programming importance went up in stock last year and now it's even more important, as the Iowa Highway Construction commercial says, "Give 'em a Brake!"
So far, it appears that I am getting good results using an uncompressed AVI as an environment map in 3ds max and rendering to a .MOV.  For whatever reason, the encoder used in Premiere is terrible and the one packaged with max seems to work.  I wish Autodesk had addressed this in the rules.  Especially because most of us render to frames and use some sort of video editing software to encode.

We have 3 connected to the Maxi Block and 1 connected via a spike.




I'm not going to touch on the rest of your post for now, since others seem to be taking care of it. However, no one addressed this sentence.

You are not allowed to attached a victor to a spike. The spike can only handle 20 amps, while the victor can handle much more. Also, the spike can put out negative polarities, which will kill the victor. All the victors must be hooked directly to a fuse (the maxi block if they drive a drill or CIM motor, or the other fuse block if they drive a different motor).

Please post here if you have any other questions. Also, go to the chatsworth competition, and ask for help there. People there should be able to help you faster then anything over the internet.

I dont have time on the frc again untill tomarrow, so Im going to have to wait to test this untill then, but what I did was strip some of the excess calories from Kevin Watson's interupt template (most of the printf library and some of the leftover first functions in user_routines) then put everything into that.

Well, that's C for you.  If you want to work with bits, you're stuck with bitfields as the most elegant solution.  Of course, you could use ints and just use macros to get at the bits -- but that is messy, and why not let the compiler do it for you automagically with the bitfield?  There's a struct already declared for you by IFI in the default code that gives you access to bits 1 - 8.  If you desire true "elegance" might I suggest just hiding everything behind a define statement -- e.g., #define mybit bitfield.bit5.

Is there anyway to stop it from bouncing and make it turn smooth?






I am currently working with 406 and we had the same problem.  In order to fix that problem we found that replacing the front tires with some that have a smooth surface will give you a nice smooth turn.

i hate to sound stupid but what is dead reckoning



Dead reckoning is when your robot performs pre-programmed commands during autonomous without the use of sensors.  Essentially, you tell the robot to turn this motor until so-and-so and this one until this, that, and the other thing.
Our large gripper! Also capable of scooping up many smaller balls and retrieving the 10pt ball with ease!
A few weeks ago we had the same problem.  It is caused by friction with the carpet.  If you place the robot on a tile surface and drive it you will find that the bouncing does not occur.  We were not able to find a way to negate this bouncing with the pnuematic tires, but rather went to a wheel with a low friction surface and it works great.  If you have any other questions fell free to IM me on AIM: DavidButzin   If I can't answer questions you have chances are I will be able to direct you to someone who can.  Hope this is helpful!
This madness is not suppose to stop anytime soon. Atleast I hope not...

I didn't see any autonomus code run at the scrimmage at the National Building museum yesterday.  Except for the one robot that looked like it tried to line follow, but it just went in circles...


Wetzel
Last year we put casters on pneumatic cyclinder on back to lift the back wheels barely off the ground.  This year we fully inflate the tires and just deal with it.  There are several good solution to this including completely inflating tires and changing a set of tires so that they will slide sideways but still drive forward.  Omni-wheels of sorts (not really, unless you can make them quick) But something that has less contact with the ground but still can grip forwards.
There's something called a "FOR LOOP".  In this loop, you can specify how long it stays in the loop.  You could increment a variable there if you wanted to 'wait' for a certain amount of time.  Or, you could use what we like to call a "TIMER".  Timers count time.  Time can be used for waiting.

Maybe you should  be a little more specific on what you're trying to do.

A few questions:
How effective were wings for aidiing in pushing balls into the corral?




Most attempts to push balls into the coral with wings or just with the robot weren't very sucessful at UTC. From my observation, the only teams that got more than a couple balls in were those who picked up the balls then spit them out to the human player. Also, a lot of teams got 10 point penalties for breaking the plane of the ball shute so I think that discouraged teams from trying to push in balls.


>
> Were goal grabbers necessary for pulling goals out of corners?


Most of the teams at UTC only moved the goals by pushing them. However, since so many teams were trying to block the human player shutes with the movable goals, I think it would be very benificial to have a goal grabber so you can reopen your ball coral.


The neutral position for our joysticks is not 127, and this is making us mess up a bit. For the left side, neutral is 165, and for the right, neutral is 193. What could be causing this, and how do we make it go back to the original 127 position?




If the neutral position is not 127 you can trim them by adjusting the wheel next to each axis on the joystick. Turn the wheel until both give you the 127 value you are looking for. Then find some heavy duty tape and hold them down so they won't move again  ;)

Note: Not the thumb wheel which you can optionally use as an input. The adjustment wheels.
the problem with having a single bit variable is that memory allocation works in bytes - you create a variable, it's gonna take up at least a byte no matter how you look at it. thus, you either have to tell the compiler explicitly to put 8 1-bit variables together (i.e. using struct to create a bitfield), or just go with byte-long variables and just give them a 0 or 1 value, using an unsigned char.


There's something called a "FOR LOOP".  In this loop, you can specify how long it stays in the loop.  You could increment a variable there if you wanted to 'wait' for a certain amount of time.  Or, you could use what we like to call a "TIMER".  Timers count time.  Time can be used for waiting.

Maybe you should  be a little more specific on what you're trying to do.




but do remember that you need to call putdata every 26.2ms or so, or else the processor will shut down, which would not be a good thing in the middle of a match.

a small not, this year's joysticks do not have thumb wheels. instead, they have the hat switches on top, which are mapped to the pX_wheel axis.

It sounds like you're having the ever popular trouble with 4 wheel drive turning. Chris Hibner wrote a really good [white paper](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=222) to help solve this problem. If none of the quick tips here work, I'm sure some of the information in this white paper will help.
if you havnt edited the printf function in your code you can use that to esaly see what values your joysticks are.  just move the trim wheel till it reads 127 ish.  the output screen for printf function is the window that pops up after loading a program


Instead of spending $50+ on each encoder, we spent a total of (maybe) $5, and it works quite well.  I wired them up with a buffer and comparator to provide a digital output, which goes to two interrupt pins.  Works great  :D



We made ours from scratch, but we kept it very small, and light. We made our disks out of polystyrene and the holder out of acrylic, cut them out on our laser. What is that big hunk of metal for, is it a guard?

Hey that sounds like our robot from last year until we switched to dead reckoning.
Oh yeah, we will be going under the ball drop for our main, our secondary incase our partner can catch better (which we shouldn't need) will be to go over to the other side and do something.  Watch for pics and video either today or tommarow (2/22 - 2/23) of us catching all 18 balls.
Remember, there is no math library included, so you will have to make your own.
Thats *usualy* because your backup battery is dead


Do you mean to tell me that the teams who got up on the platforms were only the ones who went up the tiny steps and were small enough to go around the stationary goal??  None came in from the sides??

How did the hangers hang???  Did they go up the platform(s) and then hang or just reach in for the bar from the carpeted level?




No.  There were a few teams that went up the 6" step, but it was much slower than the tiny stairs.  Ther were also alot of teams that attempted going up the 6" step but didn't make it.

All the hanging bots had some sort of arm that extended up with a hook on the end. [Like this](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/pages/96_JPG.htm) [and this.](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/pages/236hang_JPG.htm)  Both of those were on the platform when they reached for the bar.
There was one robot that tried reaching from the carpet (178).  When then hooked the bar and started putting weight on their hook, [it snapped off.](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/crappy/pages/DSCN0754_JPG.htm)
confused
Our primary is to go under the ball drop. (And our robot is capable of catching all of the balls :cool: ) Our secondary is probably to go graba movable goal and a third is to knock the bonus ball off. We probably won't do the bonus ball, since the balls drop at 45 seconds anyways and if we cathc them all and give them to our human player we should still be ok.

Oh, yeah, and we have a possible fourth, which is to do the chinup at the very beginning. Did that one mostly just for the fun of it; I mean, really, would you want to hang yourself in the first 15 seconds? :)


Our primary is to go under the ball drop. (And our robot is capable of cathing all of the balls :cool:)




we were trying to do the same thing... u better have some kind of hook to get a mobile goal out of the human plaeyr chute, because alot of teams stuffed them in there yesterday, and we were not able to deliver the balls effectively
We must have had a random arc or fell prey to static electricity.  The unit eprom does not retain the program.  Everytime you boot, it never keeps the program in memory.  We went through everything, and it was the robot controller itself.  Thanks for your posts, and I'll see you at the NJ regionals Elgin.

It was quite a bit of work getting it to run in pbasic though.  I was hoping someone had an extra we could have used in the interim.

--M
hold up.. you may not have a blown controller.. the same thign happened to us. What LED's are on when you boot up? Is it falling back into the program state every time you restart?
just curious, did any of the other scrimmages besides DC have the evil small balls of doom? or were they closer to the official size that FIRST put out?
because in DC that seemed to be one of the biggest problems for everyone... running over the majorly deflated evilness

Did any of the other scrimmage groups have that problem too, or are we just 'special'?


we were trying to do the same thing... u better have some kind of hook to get a mobile goal out of the human plaeyr chute, because alot of teams stuffed them in there yesterday, and we were not able to deliver the balls effectively


Hum, good point. We do have a movable goal manipulator (big words... :)), but it might be hard to use with balls in our hopper.
our orignal plan was to use trianglation to find the bonus balls... yeah that got real far. then we were gonna line track. but that didnt work out either. so now were just gonna dead recokon at the bonus ball, and maybe grab the 2x ball/latch on to the movable goal. so i guess thats an undetermined...


Anyone can hand the ball to the HP but only the HP can shoot.

I think it was answered in Q&A.  Check me if I'm wrong.



you are correct sir... ALSO!!!

the driver or manipulator can pick them up from what i understand... i could be wrong... can anyone verify for this??


I was actually thinking about actaully using our darn webcam their to broadcast, but LAN parties are an option as well I guess!! lol

(If that's what you were thinking) :-D



no of course... not... LOL! would be cool though to have one at a local hotel one night... get people closer together from other teams while having fun...
Speed will matter, but very little though.  Speed will be an issue during the last seconds of the game.

I'm not sure if you had it without the signed part of it, but I think this compiler is a little weird in that it defaults to unsigned. So, you have to include the signed if you want negative. Of course, like every single one of my posts, I could be wrong.
wow our team stuck 2 strips of retro reflective tape on the drillmotor-gearbox coupler and used the banner sensors... how much sucess have you had with the inturupts?


There's something called a "FOR LOOP".  In this loop, you can specify how long it stays in the loop.  You could increment a variable there if you wanted to 'wait' for a certain amount of time.  Or, you could use what we like to call a "TIMER".  Timers count time.  Time can be used for waiting.

Maybe you should  be a little more specific on what you're trying to do.


If you care, the struture of the for loop is this:


for(*initiazation*; *test*; *increment*)
{
// body of loop
}



It is more flexible than that form indicates, but that would be the most common way to use it. A quick example of it actually being used as a "pause."


// Somewhere at the top
unsigned int i;

// Later on
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
// Do nothing
}


This code would cause it to loop ten times and then continue.

Note that if you were using this as a timer, it would be different at different battery charges as the controller would run slower.

Anyways, if anyone cares, there it is.
at AZ we had what I think are the standard size balls, but I did not see a team that did not have trouble herding them due to how easy it is to ride up on them.

I know that a few teams were able to handle the 2x ball, but that did them very little good without any balls....

the thing that i learned most from the invitational this year was that we, and most other teams mis judged the importance of the different ways of playing the game. We thought that *anyone* with a moving base would be able to herd balls, but that is defently not true. the only ones that will be succesfull at it is those that actually gather them. These teams will be the ones to go far in the alliance pickings because the teams that went all out will be able to hang and cap, and do all that, but wont dominate like they thought without at bot that gathers.

so the way i se things working out is this:
the teams that do *everything* will end up doing one thing (befor the alliance picking), wich will probubly be hanging, because that is the only thing that you can do by yoursealf without a gathering alliance partner. and when the gather bots pick them because they can cap, and hang well, then they will cap when the big goal is full, and then go to hang. This is the alliance them that will win in every reagenal i bet.

furthermore I am predicting that all of the bots that gather balls will be picked, or picking. This is because that robot design was considers less ambitious by most teams, and they decided to build a hanging-2x handling bot.


Thats *usualy* because your backup battery is dead




We are running our RC w/o the backup with no troubles...
i'l put this here....

would you happen to know where to find what the asignment of each input pin on the ports on the OI are. I am looking to make a switch that controls the auto mode form the OI. also, when the OI is disabled in the begining of each match, does the RC still process data from the OI.. (can i code something into my autonomous function that looks for input pins on the OI?)


you are correct sir... ALSO!!!

the driver or manipulator can pick them up from what i understand... i could be wrong... can anyone verify for this??




Yeah it is true.  If you had an autonomous ball collector/dumper...which would be awesome to see...you could have three people feeding balls to your human player or opposite human player.


wow our team stuck 2 strips of retro reflective tape on the drillmotor-gearbox coupler and used the banner sensors... how much sucess have you had with the inturupts?




The big hunk of metal is actually the drivetrain mount - it is doubling as a sensor enclosure.  The interrupts work flawlessly - whenever something went wrong it was the circuitry, not the RC or interrupts.
We got too many, I can tell you this.

2 drills- drive
2 CIMs- drive
1 window- drive
1 vandoor- arm
1 globe- goal grabber
pneumatics- arm

And thats just whats on so far. Much more to come.
We use a set of wireless 232 modules to get data back via the programming port.  The only modification you need to make is you have to change the UART boud rate to 19.2k instead of 115k.

all of the switching is in main.c
you can force it into auton mode or disable it or whatever.
but doing so for the compitition is highly illigal and i would not advise it.
if you want a OI switch that puts it into auton mode i would sugest just getting a mockup-compition port and pluging it in to the OI. that way your code is still koshar for the compitition.
that is not the question i had... i was wondering if the RC processes data from the OI when in disabled or autonmous mode. If it does, i wanted to make a switch that would switch our auto programs (ex go for ball, hang, etc)


2 Bosch Drills
2 F-P
1 Van door
5 Cylinders

What they are used for?  Only time will tell.




Wait.. I'm confused. 5 cylinders? I thought you were only allowed 3. One provided and 2 custom. Errr I'm probably wrong, seeing that I don't read the rules on pneumatics too well. Hey, I'm a drive train guy. XP
instead of going to sleep, i would count loops till the required delay has passed. stoping a program is a **bad** thing, just because of the way the program loop is structured. if that doesnt work, i would use a timer with an inturupt.
when the OI is in disabled mode, the robot sees it as off and no data at all is transmited or received. when it is in auton mode, it does send and recieve data, but because of the construction of the RC (i.e. 2 pics that talk to eachother) you cant get to any of the data while the auton bit is high. i believe if you call the getDataFromMasterRc() all of the vars will return 127. however if you got a second RS232 reciever you may be able to snatch some values. i doubt this is legal tho. your best bet is to put a switch on your robot and run out just before the match and flip it.
lol our team has 5 serial cables strung together that follow the robot around the room. real hitech


has anyone sucsesfuly tried using the standerd CPP math library by inporting it into mplab?




I doubt it, a standard library would be rather large. I made my own, its a little slow but it gets the job done.
how did you guys make it up the 6 inches with thos tiny wheels?

What we did last year and had sucess with and what we will be doing again this year is to just use some spst switches on some digital inputs and have the dude that puts it out on the field set them. For instance

switch 1       2
on      on   == hang
off      on   == release balls
on      off   == get large ball
off      off   == get moveable goal
Those wheels sure look to be the same size that we're using.

I can assure you we get onto the step :D

then how do you do it my fine friend. How do you prevent bottoming out


The solenoid manifold is available through SMC.  We purchased ours through motion industries.

11 pistons... I will try to break it down in a fairly subtle manner.  2 for wings, 2 for center lift, 2 for rear lift, 2 for shifting ;), 1 for ball grabber, 2 for elev release.

That should hold you off until sunday.  We might not be fully functional as we just realized that our reduction for the arm is not sufficient... so we are trying to throw together a quick solution before sunday.  See you then.




We put a giant garage door spring on our arm so that we wouldn't have to have a huge reduction so it could move quickly, and hold its place without stalling the motor against the load.

It works really well.  We only used about 1 foot of spring (before we stretched it) and it isn't that heavy.

We talked to an inspector yesterday and he didn't say anything about it.  Just to be safe, we ran a steel cable through the middle and anchored it so that if some mutant witha  chainsaw attacks out bot, the spring will not fly off and kill anything.

pic:
http://www.chiefdelphi.com/pics/bin/107716227121.jpg

You can see, the globe motor with a 1:12 reduction off the gearbox is capable of lifting the arm when its fully extended and has a 10 pound weight on the far end (we used a concrete drill to approximate the weight of ball+claw).

However, to be nice to the motor (and because it was too quick to control well) we have since removed that little sprocket at the top and replaced it wil a big 80 tooth sprocket, which we used the drillpress and a 3in holesaw, with a 1 1/8 in holesaw to do touch up work.  It looks cooler, and the arm is much happier.
I think that many people will be surprised and we will see power become a large part of he game.  I feel that there will be robots that can A) Block a ball chute extremely well B) Block the midfield platform extremely well and C) keep control of your goal so you cant get balls in it.  I think to effectively defeat any of these teams, you need to have power, as well as speed.

It wouldn't be the strangest thing that every happened. Team 237 completely rebuilt their robot in 2001 after their first regional. Jessica Boucher can probably give you more details, but here is a thread about it: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13106


Yeah it is true.  If you had an autonomous ball collector/dumper...which would be awesome to see...you could have three people feeding balls to your human player or opposite human player.



The coach can also take the balls out of the corral to hand them to the human player.  This was a grey area yesterday at the UTC Scrimmage and the people who were there from FIRST said that the coach could grab out of the corral.


no of course... not... LOL! would be cool though to have one at a local hotel one night... get people closer together from other teams while having fun...

Correct.


Happy Birthday Matt Adams!




Yes, definetly enjoy your birthday!
sorry about the quality of this one, but its the only pic I could find where you could clearly see the bot in its 2wd mode http://www.chiefdelphi.com/pics/bin/107748317912.jpg
That was our initial idea/game plan, lol, but we changed our minds.
yeah, team 360 is submitting one.. but Peciv beat me to that statement ;)
I used short summary form. On a couple of the questions I did it in "short essay form", the ones I thought needed some additional polishing (most important questions).
Hope that helps :)
WOW. Good Luck. I put about 3 weeks into writing, rewriting, and revising our submission.
Im sure someone will, but id recomend you check out FIRSTs C programming tutorial so you arnt stuck next year.
http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/C_help.htm
It helps some if you have someone that did pbasic (assuming your not a rookie team :D) because its not all that diffrent, its just daunting at first but youl get the hang of it.
er, you guys *ARE* using the safty cut off valves and safety bleed valves, right :D
That is absolutley gorgeous. That style was my first idea that came to mind right after Kickoff....but it is the kids' decision as to where the final design goes :)

Congrats on getting it to work!
What is it?
I went to the FIRST website and all I found was a WORD document, so I put our information in that and sent that, along with the submission, to the email address.

Here's a question, after I sent it in the submission, I got an email that says "received", was I supposed to get a message that included "and complies" or not? If it doesn't say "and complies", is that bad?
How do you get the balls from inside the hopper to inside the corral?

Good job.  If you can have that sort of success during most of your rounds, you're going places fast.
I suspect that those of you who are having overheating problems with the compressor haven't installed the new version of the ifi_aliases.h file. The relayx_fwd and relayx_rev aliases are reversed in the original version of the code, and that makes it highly probable that you've been running the compressor backwards. If the compressor polarity is reversed, it will still compress air, but its internal cooling fan will not work properly. Make sure the light on the Spike supplying power to the compressor is green. If not, either swap the compressor wires or fix the programming using the new version of the header file from IFI.


Amazing.  It looks just like I imagined it should.  Do you have the autonomous worked out yet?  I so wanted to make a robot exactly like this but I don't have enough say.  Congratulations on making such a great KISS machine.




T/y for all the compliments.  To answer your question regarding autonomous mode, we have the program and will be testing it today.  It is quite simple since all we have to do is drive like around 4 feet out and expand.  We will be using optical encoders for dead reckoning (and for auto trany).

For the getting the balls out.  We have a ball collector that can move the balls out as well.


after going to a scrimmage, are any teams deciding to redo their robot in the 4 days befor it ships? They may seem crazy, but i think we are going to try it and see what happens. We were totally off the ball with our strategy this year, and we think we need to to entirely re design and re think everything.



What strategy was it, if you don't mind my asking, that proved so unsuccessful?
I wish people would explain themself when they say they hate Macs.  It seems that more people hold a grudge with Apple IIe's from elementary school or something.  New Mac's are awesome.  OSX has the perfect combination of power and ease of use.  It looks great and works so fluidly.  More game developers are designing games for Mac.. so there has begun to be a decent selection of games.  Also, since many companies use iD's Quake engines in their games, it's simpler for them to port to Mac.

I'm also not a Windows-hater.. it works for me.  I'm still happy with my AthlonXP desktop.  It was much cheaper than any Mac, but it doesn't look nearly as cool. :)
We don't think controlling the 2x is that big of a deal and that getting 5 point balls to the human player is much better
grabbing the 2x ball. They seam to be the stacks of last year. Also, we would like to add a hanging feature, it seems like a good idea.
the balls can be put anywhere in the team area as long as they stay in there correct?
Maybe this? http://www.precisionsales.com/rocker.html its a "rocker pot" that looks like a rocker switch, but its analog instead of digital. Is a custom job so you got to email the manufacturer [email]eparts@ix.netcom.com[/email]

or this http://www.4qd.co.uk/accs/pots.html


grabbing the 2x ball. They seam to be the stacks of last year. Also, we would like to add a hanging feature, it seems like a good idea.



Manipulating the 2x balls will probably be excessively successful for those teams who can manipulate them excessively well.  Likewise, the strategy will probably be moderately successful for those teams who can perform the task moderately well.
blocking a ball chute with a robot doesn't just depend on motors...You need traction so the other teams don't push you around...a big gear ratio will help in them not being able to move you also.



For the getting the balls out.  We have a ball collector that can move the balls out as well.




Is that a  1-roller system? How fast does it work? Good job on the bot.
Trig seems a little bit on the touchy side. You have the problem of the tracking, the angle, and the precision. Being off by a degree could send you very much where you don't want to go. My team discussed this early on, and discarded it. An INS and a gyro chip will be much easier, although a bit pricy, and it's a bit late in the season. Have fun with that. I don't envy your programmer.
That is true, but you need 5 point balls in the goal to double. So it's a major trade-off
are you saying that because you have seen the competetion, or becasue you are defending what your strategy is?
No that isn't legal. However, they can pass balls back and forth
I don't think I've seen this question addressed but I would stick with that the human players have to stay in their own area.  I remember them making strict rules about staying in your own player station.  Last year the player station were together so if the player station for both teams is connected together I would say yes you could.  But it seems like they may have seperate player stations for the competition this year and with the strict rules they have about player stations I would definitely say you would have to be on your own side then.  I'm sticking with you have to be on your own side but if they are connected again I see no reason you couldn't have two on one side.

Joe is probably right.  It didn't seem like they would let you.
how far can this passing go...like walk all the way over there and hand it to the person...or just tossing?
My question is are you going to park right under the player station at the beginning of the match, and if you do that how will you trigger the release of the balls during Autonomous Mode??

Great looking bot guys, can't wait to see it in action at Midwest.  :]
I waited almost two days to get the response "received" and I was worried the whole time!   I didn't get "complies".
Just watch a practice match or try things out in the practice matches.  Some things are hard to tell what will exactly happen until you get there.  Las year we couldn't toss tubs we had to slide them.  Maybe you'll have to slide balls.


Thanks Joe.  I never have enough time to read all the Q&As.
I've actually considered a mac in the future, but I just don't think I could handle the change from Windows to another operating system.  I think I'll go with a Sony or a Toshiba.
That's a big risk of losing the ball though. At yesterdays UTC scrimmage there didnt seem to be much room between the 2 drivers stations in back because of the ball release support
Wow, I hope I get to see that in action some time this year...our tracks don't look nearly as sweet as that...something to aspire to though.

Whatever we do, it's not calling up the local radioshack and asking for 6 AWG butt connectors, not at all. We have, however, determined that on enough caffine and not enough sleep, the most interesting things are said that the person did not intend. I'm sure Freud would be impressed.

Last year, we riced out our robot with neon lights (red and blue), but the tubes didn't really appreciate impact very well. Other hobbies include quake on a projector (and wolfenstein 3d, and rise of the triad, we be old skool, or something, definitely or something), seeing who can make the most creative things out of cable ties, and who can hold the most caffine before vibrating apart.

My question is are you going to park right under the player station at the beginning of the match, and if you do that how will you trigger the release of the balls during Autonomous Mode??





With that the 30 second wait is worth it.  Some people won't get a ball in the corral in 30 seconds.  I would like to know if they can capture balls from the bottom up (suck them into to their hopper).  Or are they just training their HPs really good.  A great idea would be to feed the HPs all the balls and then drive in front of the stationary goal to catch balls they miss  short.
Our robot is still under construction - so I'm not sure what to do about the photo requirement...  Any ideas?

I modified a pwm cable a bit by removing the middle pin of the male connector, and sodering the other two to corresponding wires of the line sensor.  I just want to make sure that this is legal.




as long as it plugs into the RC and not a spike or a victor!  :D
Also, don't forget to watch out for the DQ of breaking the imaginary line between the playing field and the ball corral :)
wow thats amazing are you using pnumatics or motors to move the... bucket?
The switch is so easy.  If you're talking about laptops, Apple laptops are way better than any Windows laptop I have ever used.  The interface is so simple that anyone can use it.  I had never touched OSX before I got my Powerbook, but no work of any kind was required to use it.  Plugged everything in.  Bam.  It worked.

If you're talking about desktops, then whatever.. But I don't ever plan on buying a Windows laptop :)

Yeah, our neons didn't fair so well either. I think the converter or whatever it is blew when it arched and burnt my finger. Oh well. I think we voided the warranty anyway. But they were only $30. I zip-tied my $500 camera to it once, which was a lot more risky...but we got some great shots.
Well, I did an original storyboard, but I'm no artist by hand. I'd changed the flow of things and where some events took place enough that it warranted a new storyboard, and considering that you are judged partially by how well you follow your storyboard...

When people screw up, we usually give them the prize, which is awarded by yelling "YOU WIN THE PRIZE!". Sometimes we also give the recipient the actual physical prize, which is a bunch of zip ties attached to a plastic bag. Very dignified and all that.

We have also developed an unhealthy obsession with the following, which is simultaneously hilarious and good at explaining our autonomous features:

I'm saying it because most FIRST games are similar in structure.  There's always that one key element that can bring a team to the top.  You all remember the insane ball collectors in 2002, and the amazing 2003 stackers, don't you?

The ONLY way to do small balls.

I envisioned such a machine, but we didn't have the guts to pull it off this year (We decided on a different philosophy).  This looks GREAT.  I can't wait to see how well it works, and how many other teams try such a strategy.

Major Kudos,

I've used both.

They both have their high points.
They both have their low points.

I prefer Windows over Mac;  I can work faster on a Windows machine, most likely due to the lack of experience on a Mac.
Seems to me that you would need some way to knock the 2x ball of one of the goals since you need they you can't get any balls in them without removing them.


It sounds like you're having the ever popular trouble with 4 wheel drive turning. Chris Hibner wrote a really good [white paper](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=222) to help solve this problem. If none of the quick tips here work, I'm sure some of the information in this white paper will help.



That white paper doesn't appear to be available at the moment.
I think the 2X will become more important as the game goes on.  I expect the finals will be stacked with team that can manipulate the 2x and hang alliances with small ball manipulators, some who might be able to hang.  In finals, there is no reason to do everything individual, but do everything collectively very well.
getting balls into the mobile goal is REALLY hard though...i think i only saw some in there a few times at the scrimmage...the stationary goal is so much easier to get balls into

> Our neon issues resulted from impact, not wiring faults. 6-gauge butt connectors are ALWAYS funny, though.

Dam you stole my idea or did you......
I will be surprized if you see very many people passing balls or tossing them to each other.

Why toss it to the other human player when you can toss it into the goal in less time? (you dont have to wait for the goal to look at you so you can toss it :^)
That's so cool... Awesome bot.

Question: What is at the bottom of the 'bucket' to protect the robot and itself from the impact of 18 balls?
Could you post what signals are connected where?

Ie.  joystick 1 y is the right drive command
pwm1 is connected to the right drive motor (0 = full forward, 255 = full reverse)

or something?


Based on your second statement, I am assuming that you want code now, not when you get to St. Louis.
My guess is that they went up the small steps and around the goal.  Then pulled themselves up from there.

?!?!?!?!   :ahh:

the  microprocessor runs on 5V, regulated from the 12 or 7.2V batteries - and the timing is controlled by a crystal that doesnt care what the battery voltages are

the execution of uP instruction cycles will be dead accurate repeatable, no matter what the state of your battery is, until the battery drops far enough to cause a reset.

I think the people that are contemplating wait states, for loops, do loops or while loops in their code really need to get the default users manaul and get a grasp on how this SW runs

the program takes in inputs from the operator
then it does your processing
then it outputs the results of your processing to the victors and spikes

those three major tasks repeat continiously - you DONT want to pause or stop or put timing delays in your processing area - you want the code to continue to run and loop as fast as it can

so if you are waiting for something to happen, and it hasnt happend yet, then do nothing and check again on the next 'pass' of the SW.

Putting wait states or delays in your code is one of the surest ways to make the controller lock up, and set all your outputs to 'off'  - when this happens your bot will go dead and you will have a very expensive, very fancy statue sitting on the field infront of 3000 people.


that is pure awsomness... so nice... just... NICE!!! lol... this kid is awsome! haha




Of course he's awesome! That's why we're so proud to have him on our team. :)
uhh ohh.. looks like the nasa rover drive train.. or something very similiar.. if you did that.. your bot will most likely scare me :-)

If your bot really looks like that model.. I bet its quite amazing
i can see one time, if the mobile goal is on the other side and it's about to be capped...not very good chance of this happening...but better to know the rules before hand and know your options instead of getting a penalty or DQ'd
AMAZING JOB!  That is exactly what I wanted to do.  It is beautiful and hopefully very reliable.  It should get you very far in competition.  Best of luck with it.
It's nice to know that we're not the only ones using lots of PVC. What are you using to control those side wings?


I'm saying it because most FIRST games are similar in structure.  There's always that one key element that can bring a team to the top.  You all remember the insane ball collectors in 2002, and the amazing 2003 stackers, don't you?




The 2003 stacking i dont think was nearly as important as the 2002 gather/collecting of balls. Last year my teams robot was based mainly around stacking...and what good did that do?....we could stack 7 high but it s pointless b/c a robot could very easily knock it down.

And from my view hanging from the bar is gonna be like that...goood in theory but very little effect/usefullness in the game. Im thinking that moving/controlling the small balls and controlling the 2x balls will be the most important this year.
jus my thought
try turning your robot off and check the wires for continuty with an ohm meter

one common mistake that people sometimes make is to crimp a terminal on with the insulation pushed into the metal part of the terminal - the terminal will  feel good and snug, but there wont be any electrical contact.

also , make sure you smaller fusebox has power and ground all the way back to the battery.

BTW- it is possible to push the PWM cables into a victor at an angle, so the pins do not go into the mating contacts - it will look seated, but there is no connection

when the yellow light on the victor blinks that means it is not getting any PWM data from the RC. This can be due to:

1. the pwm cable being backwards at one end (common mistake)
2. the OI is not on, or the OI competiition adapter is in 'disable'
3. something in your code is not putting out PWM commands to those pin - this can be checked with a servo - if you plug a servo into the pwm and it works, your code is ok and you have a wireing problem.
4. the laws of physics were repealed and nobody told you :c)

omg.

Please say that thing has a 426 HEMI in in it?
I disagree with the hanging being like stacking last year. Every team that hung yesterday at the UTC scrimmage pretty much won the matches they were in. There are so many different things to do in this years game that 2 minutes isnt enough to do it all
I  like it, it's nice to see the old team coming up with new tricks.  I'll see you all in St. Louis.  Who knows, maybe we'll be working together.
At the UTC scrimmage yesterday seemed like it wasnt really necessary to lower the bar. Unless the robot is hanging like 5 feet off the ground I don't think the bar is going to be lowered.
I believe one of the updates said you are allowed to tether in order to release pneumatics or whatever you need to do to get down.

ditto to velocipenguin on the pvc. Our whole arm is made out of it for now unless we have time to make one out of metal for the comp.
we dont drill no stinking holes in our robot

we poke them through with a pick-axe!

BTW, if you need to save about 5 pounds, have your robot weighed with a dead battery - you'd be amazed how much those trillions of tiny electrons weigh!

EDIT: oh I just remembered - they make you turn your bot on when its weighed, to make sure you are not using a dead battery  :o
could u possibly post a larger image? it's really hard too see it


From kickoff, the bar will be lowered down to 6ft to detach robots.

However, looking at the recent pics of robots, and considering various designs, robots on the bar will most likely be at various heights above the platform. Many also use pneumatics. After a match is scored, will FIRST judges/refs let team members onto the field in order to detach the robots in order as they come down and to let air out from the pneumatics so various devices may retract?




At competition, the officals will let you tether your bots after the match like normal to remove them from the field.  You can release all pneumatics and other devices while tethered.  The bar will also be lowered if need be.  Though it is expected, you must have your bot off the field withing 30secs of the time you are called on to remove it, SO make it easily manually removable.
We weighed at each step, but somehow we gained a ton of weight... 165-170lbs last weighing, yikes! We probably have to amputate some features :(. Anyone know the difference between 16 gauge wire and 10 gauge wire weights? ;)
make sure your RC is perminatly mounted and is not "set in" as it seems to be in that photo.
Is there a maximum PWM wire connecting the solenoid to the spike? We just fried ours, and want to step it up : ).

Thanks,

This was a problem at the UTC scrimmage 716 was bouncing out of control they didn't have the problem as bad after taking most of the air pressure out of there tires. Increasing the pressure made it bounce higher. even though really hard to control it looks rather amusing :D
Thanks for the inquiry, Chris.  Well, we had a great day sizing up area teams and seeing what our machine could do. As for climbing the stairs, I do not remember seeing anyone try it from the front, up the three small stairs. Most of the bots took the 6" climb up to the top of the first platform.
Those machines that use the grey tires tended to spin a little and bounce a lot. I am sure with proper adjusting, etc. that problem can be fixed. It was surprising in that only one bot at the warm-up could direct balls to the corral. The other shocker came when the length of almost all the simulated games seemed to be very short. With the challenge of the game this year, and so many possibilites, time really does fly.
Good luck to you and your team. Come visit us if you are in one of the regionals or the International. We are truly blessed to have great friends and able to meet so many nice people because of FIRST.  :cool:
simply amazing, great work, are you guys a rookie team?

i would like to see the whole animation, as no point hiding it now, i wana see how you have implemented this kinda model in a first animation
Yes, this is the first year our school has entered FIRST.
WOW. that is amazing...how long did it take you to do that rendering?
we do have the printf function showing us a number of things through hyperterminal, and thats where we got the readings of 165 and 193 from.


How many drivers from last years St. Louis comp. are returning?  This will be my 3rd and final year as our teams driver. :(  :D

Just wonderin' who I'll be "running into" down in St. Louis

Is there a maximum PWM wire connecting the solenoid to the spike? We just fried ours, and want to step it up : ).

Thanks,

If your talking about how many solenoids can be wired to each spike, that number is one.  All though (as the 2004 wiring diagram shows) you can wire upto 3 solenoids each through their own spike to 1; 30 amp fuse on the breaker.
Have you tried calibrating?

Center the joystick, press and hold the CAL button, move the stick all around while pressing, then center the stick and let go.

Also, do you have a jumper on the AB or BC setting?
the fact that its doing a little light show makes it sound like its going into test mode - or maybe resetting?

innovationfirst should be able to tell you what that means - when you find out, please post it here so we all know what it is (just in case :c)

You do have something with that last year we had one battery we bought weighed almost a pound less then the one in the kit.
It looks amazing.....but, I have no idea what it is......

I can tell its a ribcage, but it looks like its for something like outta cgtalk.com's forums, not a FIRST animation....

Could you post the animation, or give us a in-depth detail explanation of what you are trying to convey?

EDIT: BTW, I was wondering, how did you get that subtle glow on the vieins, or lungs, or whatever it is.....

I hope you guys get far with this animation, although I have to warn you, the main problem that I saw with the animations from last year was that some of them made no sense at all, they could have looked amazing, but you didn't know what they were trying to say..... Hopefully your animation is as amazing as these renders....
adjust your trim tabs on the joysticks - the little black thumbnobs on the white base of the unit.
i have found that this years joysticks really don't have that wonderful of a center position. we are using sticks from previous years.... other than the trim tabs being off you may need to do some scaling. what we do is this

#define left_MAX 254
#defing left_MIN 16

pwm01 = ((pwm01 - left_MIN) * 256) / (left_MAX-left_MIN);

this is the basic way we do it. i don't have the code with me but i know we break up the equation so we don't lose as much in the dividing so that the dividing is easier on the proc.
Good job! We're also using pnuematics to pull ourselves up. Our compressor runs quite a bit but our pnuematics have worked flawlessly so far.
(shhhhhh! thats cause you live in Canada and they figure they can send you defective batteries and you wont bother to weight them in kilograms and convert it to pounds to see if you got everything you paid for!

we have had great sucess with the diode method. however i was wondering if there was a way, using 1 standerd double solonoid valve and a piston, to stop the piston mid-stroke electronicly? our arm group wants me to do this in the wireing and i have no idea how to even begein.
Wow, thats awesome, I watched that video and that worked amazing.

I'm glad you guys have had such success, mayb I'll see you guys at nationals again and have late nights playing poker and driving seguways! lol
197 is not a sloppy center position problem -  thats halfway to full power  :ahh:

and your code still wont help them if they dont adjust the trim tabs :^)
For our hanging device we would tether and lowering our boat hook.  However our current plan has us dangling pulling ourselves all the way to the top so we will have to use our tallest member to reach the tether port.  Now whats really interesting is that our tallest point on the robot when suspended is 22 ft. ;) :ahh:
The message is somewhere along the lines of FIRST inspiring young minds to put their hearts into their work... only if/when this happens can true success be achieved. The heart of the team is the heart of the machine.

Things like that.

I actually posted this thread in two places by accident,
the other one is [here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25820)  so you can post there to make things simpler.


Makes sense.  We will just do a brake or something to prevent it from sliding . .  it barely does as is . . . and it doesn't when the power is off, so maybe we will just look at the jumper on the victor and switch it to stop the slide.

I guess testing is in order, but its not a huge problem.


Thanks for the replies.



The Speed controller can apply an electronic brake even when the robot is disabled, this prevents the motor from back driving.
when do we get to see the whole movie?
what you might wana try is to write a dead zone into code...
if(p1_x &gt; 115 && p1_x &lt;135) {p1_x = 127;}
just a thought.
So what is around this venue in NJ it is our first time going we want to find something to do.

571- is staying at the Hampton Inn @ holiday hill
Our scale only goes up to 25 lbs.  We weighed our bot at a scrimage yesterday and it weighed 126 lbs.  40 lbs had been added in the previous 48 hours before that (we went build crazy, adding a second deck that folds out and an arm that looks more like a scorpion's tail than anything else.)  We had to change some pneumatic stuff today, and we would have gone over weight.  So we made the second deck and tail look like the muzzle of an automatic rifle ^_^

Before we ship it out, I want to count the amount of zipties that are in used on our Bot.  I think I'll count weight-holes too.  I can't belive we have more holes than zipties . . .
EDIT: I sent you an email and a PM
Ok, you'll need two global variables (put them in user_routines_fast.c, or something):
Code:

unsigned int delay_count = 0;
unsigned int delay_constant = 0;
enum {PROGRAM_RUNNING, PROGRAM_DELAY} program_state = PROGRAM_RUNNING;


Have a function:
Code:

void delay(unsigned int count)
{
if (!delay_constant) {
delay_constant = count;
delay_count = 0;
program_state = PROGRAM_DELAY;
}
if (delay_count >= delay_constant) {
delay_constant = delay_count = 0;
program_state = PROGRAM_RUNNING;
} else {
delay_count += 26;
}
}

This function should be called something like this: (in user_routines_fast.c)
Code:

Getdata(&rxdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will be stuck here forever! */

if (PROGRAM_RUNNING == program_state) {
/* Add your own autonomous code here. */
} else {
delay(0);
}

Putdata(&txdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will get no PWM outputs! */
}

Now, anytime you want to set a delay, simply have a call to delay(milliseconds) somewhere in the autonomous code.

Most of this might not compile.

300 watts? thats less than half a HP! that thing will be a dog on a hill.

Also, when you try to stop quickly you will go right over the handlebars. The awesome thing about the Segway is that it quickly becomes an extension of yourself - the selfbalancing seems like it anticipates where you want it to go.

This knockoff with too many wheels, on the otherhand, looks very unstable.

Worst thing about this isnt the competition with Segway, its that people will ride the clone and say, "Man what a piece of junk this is" and then they will assume the Segway is the Sameway.
Our IFI Loader just died on us.
It tries to download, and successfully finds the RC.  After getting to the "Erasing: Device..." stage (which it does not do because the code is still on the robot) then the thing says "Not connected..." and the download button disappears.  The PROGRAM STATE LED first blinks, goes solid and stays solid.
We've tried changing the COM ports, cables, rebooting the computer, turning the robot on and off.  Everything short of reinstalling the software.
If you've heard of this and have a solution, anything please help!
okay but is the ground stud required on the robot or can we use a replacement equivilent (ground bus) our team never got a ground stud and there fore it was never mounted.. you see where this is going
what else can u guys do?? amazing.
at first we were 3 or 4 feet above the bar, but with a couple minutes and a sawzall we are about 2" above it.
I would not use the ground stud as a +12V stud - its too open and could be easily shorted to the chassis by a stray piece of metal, or a loose screw.


**i have some expiriance with "shifting" in the transmition. our robot from last year shifted gears with two 2 stroke pistons. there was just one problem, we had alot of truble shifting from high to low and from low to high. the pistons pushed the gears back and forth just enough to mesh with the high and low gear. the problem we had was the gears wouldn't mesh, they would just hit into each other and spinn. this made the loudest sound 'cause the teethe of the gears would be rubbing up against eachother making the high pitched sound. i just wanted to know how you guys were shifting and if you had that problem. if you did have that problem, how did u solve it. my team eventualy solved it. we bought a sec of micro files and started fileing away at the gaps inbetween the teeth to make them mesh easier (dave lavery told us to do that one) but it still never worked rite.


by the way...i wish my team can wire like that...its amazing, it make me want to cry :D ** [/quote]
with all our functions on there we are now only about a pound or so over weight
well, nothing worked. but our team veiws this as a sucess, because for every practice round it saves us a round at richmond.

at first i had forgoten to plug the drive train back in, and the radio was pluged into the program port. the next time our driver tried to go up the 6" with the lift up and fliped our bot. our third match we had a dead battery, so everything worked fine till it ran out of juice and left us stitting there, holding the 2x ball, with not enugh power to even drive foward to cap the goal.

lessons learned:
check ALL connectors
check and replace battery before EVERY match
bring spare batterys and chargers
double check everything

hope to see you all in richmond
after the UTC scrimmage we have now had good test with the transmissions and the plastic gears held up fine but for precautions we have modified metal ones to take there place
Nice job with the arms. Did you bend them yourself? And what are you using to activate them? I'll also say it's kind of ironic how the ball matches the pipes/ductwork in your shop.
i wouldent try to use it as a +12v stud (lol thats what the main breakers for) but i was just wondering if we needed it at all. the q/a above is kinda blury, i read it as not **all** of the grounds have to go thrugh the stud. but do **any** of them have to?
*coughlinuxcough*.... anyway did you check the pins on the cable/port, have you tried a different computer. System specs/type of com ports (usb or built in) ext

The more succesful pneumatic shifting trannys don't actually slide gears back and forth -- this is problematics for exactly the reason you just described.  Look at the Technokat's 2003 tranny for an example of how to build a shift on the fly tranny (i'm sure there are others, but our bot was involved in an unhealthy (at least for our bot) relationship with the Technokat's bot, so I remember theirs the most).  Instead ofmoving gears, they moved a dog which basically selected which gear (the one for high gear or the one for low gear) was locked to the driveshaft, allowing the gear that wasn't in use to slide on the driveshaft.  They used a dog, three massive prongs on each side, slightly angled, that mated with three depressions on each gear.  Neither gear was locked to the shaft, but the dog was, so by engaging the dog with the gear they wanted they locked that gear to the shaft allowing the other to just spin.

I'm not sure how clear that was, go look up pics from last year for a better idea.[/quote]
yea id  like to see something like that, i looked at team 236's auton code like that durring the UTC scrimmage but i didn't get a good handle on how it worked it was only a quick glance they were helping me out  with the timers heh i almost have them working now. ill post it if i get it working.
I ment that the units given were mV/degree/second. So you would have to scale or use a finer unit. I don't actually know what happens if you use the straight rate faster than a second (or scaled to).

I think that if you divide by the number of times the interupt occurs per second, it will work. Again, I'd like a confirmation!
is that the yaw rate sensor that came in the kop last year? ours looks bigger...
have you had any sucess programing it? i think its rs232 but i have no idea where to start in terms of an algorithom or whatnot. i just have no idea.
what type of algorithom would you use to determin your relitive postition from logged yaw rate data? is there something obious that im missing?


I waited almost two days to get the response "received" and I was worried the whole time!   I didn't get "complies".





:ahh: I'm skeered!

OH TEH NOS! THE FIRST HA&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;0RS STOLED MY CHAIRMANS SUBMISSION!
our original plan was to do something like that too. we also had a crazy idea to use the "wings" to block opponents views. but then we couldn't block views and we abandoned it. because we couldn't pick up big balls.
I didnt bend them personaly, but we did bend them in our shop. They arnt exactly perfectly the same, we just bent them by clamping them to a bench and used a pipe bender lever thingy. You cant realy see them in that picture, but they have little rollers at the end which pop a ball right into their grip. Their actuated with a pnumatic cylinder. Im going to post another picture when I decide which one is the best later tonight or tomarrow... or eventualy... :D


Well, I would recommend getting a replacement battery if you're using silicone to keep it form leaking, that's just not safe.

Anyway, my team decided to do swiss cheese form the beginning. We don't have a lot of weight issues this year, since we went with aluminum plates instead of extrusion this year (big difference in accessability and weight). Besides that, the only thing we cut down on weight is our towers for the elevators. As soon as we got those, we slapped them on the mill and designed out weight reduction (patterns, and our team number and school name). All in all, it was more succesful this year then previous ones when it comes to weight.





We have a 3 inch hole saw.  Bye bye weight.

Unfortunatly we are at 130 lbs right now, but we still have to add our claw.  This will probably entail removing our wings (which weren't really going to work, anyway)
by the way, matt forgot to tell 195 is staying at the mariott


oh not possible is it??!! I will make one... all i need is duct tape and a high powered hole saw...





Don't forget the zipties ^_^
Team 007, Parkville Robotics

Our 8th year but we changed the name last year (used to be the Knights which is school mascot because there were so many knights out there)
By luck our assigned FIRST # = 7
Parkville = school name

We've had a lot of fun with this theme this year.  The robot is "Odd Job".  We also have a lot of things called "Q".  And no, we aren't the team from California with those snazzy posters (although we'd love to have some!)  But our logo last year was almost identical, with the drill. It was changed this year.

We got a recycled FIRST number.  We are not the "7" in the Hall of FIRST Fame and this has led to some confusion over the years.  I'm not sure when FIRST stopped recycling numbers but it's a good thing.
I also thought this one was pretty sweet...

There is actually no way to stop a piston's throw electronically, it depends totally on air pressure. You can slow it down a great deal using the special valve fittings FIRST supplied.

00:15 regular

Our team, more specifically our mentor Mr. Cokeley, has developed an unhealthy obsession with a certain online video clip featuring a curious cat who jumps onto a ceiling fan, goes around a few times, then slams into a wall.  Our entire team finds the video quite amusing, actually.  It's good stuff.
Shaft encoders are much simplier and probably just as acurate. Oh, and fast.
if I actually worked on the robot this year, I could answer that... Instead, I worked almost exclusively alone on the Chairmans submission. And I've worked for many many many hours alone on that.
But in years past, I've been the only one awake for 2-3 hours, while everyone else was crashed-out on the floor.

ooooh boy, where do I begin... from what I've observed, most recent error was spending an hour wiring something up on the arm, only to find out it was done wrong, spent another 40 or so min un-wiring it, then another hour to wire it correctly :)
Ya know, when the concept was first brought up I thought, "Neat idea, but I don't think you have enough weight to work with to do that." But you pulled it off!!

Very, very cool guys! I can't wait to see it in action!! ;) :D
longest a group of 4 of us worked on it? nearly 48 hours... we got to skip school for 2 days


The 2003 stacking i dont think was nearly as important as the 2002 gather/collecting of balls. Last year my teams robot was based mainly around stacking...and what good did that do?....we could stack 7 high but it s pointless b/c a robot could very easily knock it down.

And from my view hanging from the bar is gonna be like that...goood in theory but very little effect/usefullness in the game. Im thinking that moving/controlling the small balls and controlling the 2x balls will be the most important this year.
jus my thought



Granted stacking was a bit overshadowed by plowing last year, I still think hanging will be an essential aspect to winning this year's game.  An extra 50 point, 100 if both partners can do it, is a huge advantage.


I was under the impression that the RC was disabled at the beginning of the match, not the OI. I even wired a switch based on this. Like this
__T__ RC Status
-xx:xx Disabled
00:00 Auton
00:15 regular



what?
The OI (I assume your talking about the "operator interface") is "enabled" BUT your not allowed to read anything on it durring the autonomus period, like last year. The robot is to run entirly on its own (using rc inputs/sensors) or on its own dead reaconing. If you want an autonomus mode selector switch, it MUST be on the robot itself, it doenst matter how the rc reads the switches as long as you dont go over your $300 electronics limit (it was changed from $200 in one of the updates if you missed it). If the judges notice anything odd on your OI or in your code, they wont let you pass inspection.
What error? What file is it in?


Our IFI Loader just died on us.
It tries to download, and successfully finds the RC.  After getting to the "Erasing: Device..." stage (which it does not do because the code is still on the robot) then the thing says "Not connected..." and the download button disappears.  The PROGRAM STATE LED first blinks, goes solid and stays solid.
We've tried changing the COM ports, cables, rebooting the computer, turning the robot on and off.  Everything short of reinstalling the software.
If you've heard of this and have a solution, anything please help!





Hmm.. I had this problem before and it was related to a change i had just made to my code.... No clue why.. but it was solved by unchanging the code.

The code was something like:



default_routine()
{
.....
if (something)
{
Put_Data();
return;
}
.....
Put_Data();
}



we do have the printf function showing us a number of things through hyperterminal, and thats where we got the readings of 165 and 193 from.




Yeah, sounds like its a calibration problem, not a programming fix - can you clarify what you mean by "neutral"? If those numbers are what your RC is outputting to make the victors solid yellow (neutral), then it definately sounds like your victors are just out of whack and need to be recalibrated.
Like, You actually downloaded something? That's AWESOME!!! :):):):):)


last year we wieghed 80lbs!!! to bad this year we are 130-135ish.

can you add decorations after you wiegh in??




any weight added by decorations must make you still under weight after you weigh every thing together needs to be under 130 :(  it sucks we wont get to paint our arm and other things no room for weight
Wow, that bot is really cool
Cool, can you tell me how to do it? :)

Maybe you got an enginneering sample. :)

You DID download the default code, right?
I just want you to know we have several extras from previous years and I will ask the team tommorrow wether they would want to donate one. We're also using the Flightsticks this year since the drivers preferred them over this years (we started with this years). I do know my team would definitely like to keep some for spares in case something happens to ours and for possibly operating last years robot. I or someone from my team will let you know by tommorrow night.
That doesnt make any sense... I have used Put_Data() out of its intended spot with no problem... Though it wasnt inside that function. Anyway the controler doenst debug code while downloading... It could have been an error with the origional compile though, or a corrupted hex file... Cheese_Head, did you try deleating the hex file and any ".o" files and recompiling it?
... when you walk into target not realizing you still had your safety glasses on

... when you ask your robotics teammate with you "how stupid do I look" while walking thru target with safety glasses on

... when he replies " [sarcastically] Nooo, not at all! [/sarcastically], I think its more so the zip ties hanging out of your pocket that do it."
thank you.. 237 has been such a big help this year. first the motor mounts and now this.

Thanks!
You might have a hard time getting up the step with the saw there.  I think dewalt would win.  It would be a good match though.  j/k lol.  Nice robot though.  It just looks really cool, especially that control box.  Good job team.
wow that is genus. i am amazed. speechless. perfect thread.
It doesnt mesh gears.  It is a modified technokat tranny.  (here is your hint)  *If technokats used 1 piston for 2 speeds*.......Take a guess.  As much as I would love to upload the pictures, my team has still not given me permission to do so ;)

I also want to apologize to those teams expecting to see our robot at chatsworth today.  We were working on some final details and ran into some problems.  We decided we really needed to get it working properly before any real 'testing' happened.
You have a month to program after you ship the bot. :)
that is an amazing thread.
That is awesome! Is that independent suspension? It reminds me of the Mars rovers. That plow looks real good too.
they may want to do some driver practice.
besides climbing the stairs what exactly are you trying to acomplish?
My thought was that after it's done waiting, you set a new value. And just do a putdata and a getdata in the loop.
If they cant we should be able to just PM me to let me know
im sorry that i have to reiterate this, but you CAN NOT stop the program code from looping! no matter if it is with a non exastant "wait()" command or a for loop that devides PI by 100 million 50 thousand times, dont do it! it is much better, and perhaps the only viable solutuion, if you **count** the loops rather then trying to stop in the middle of one. each loop is ~26 ms. its not **that** hard to make 1 variable. comon guys.
I am about to win a bid for a new joystick on ebay for 1$. You might want to try the same thing
I think they were showing the "mysterius" black box... which is most likely empty... or evil   :eek: :D


The more succesful pneumatic shifting trannys don't actually slide gears back and forth -- this is problematics for exactly the reason you just described.  Look at the Technokat's 2003 tranny for an example of how to build a shift on the fly tranny (i'm sure there are others, but our bot was involved in an unhealthy (at least for our bot) relationship with the Technokat's bot, so I remember theirs the most).  Instead ofmoving gears, they moved a dog which basically selected which gear (the one for high gear or the one for low gear) was locked to the driveshaft, allowing the gear that wasn't in use to slide on the driveshaft.  They used a dog, three massive prongs on each side, slightly angled, that mated with three depressions on each gear.  Neither gear was locked to the shaft, but the dog was, so by engaging the dog with the gear they wanted they locked that gear to the shaft allowing the other to just spin.

I'm not sure how clear that was, go look up pics from last year for a better idea.




**
i no wat u mean by the cats transmiton, that cleard it up about a 64th......o jeeze i've been at robotics to much :ahh:**


could u possibly post a larger image? it's really hard too see it




I'll have to say the same thing. Even when you click on it it doesn't open in a larger frame. From what I could see though they are using at least one pair of the larger Skyway wheels and also have a plow on the front. It's tough to make out anything else --- maybe that's what they wanted, to surprise us at comp! :p
What my team mate (Charley) was saying is that we went to use our pneumatics and the wiring smoked.  Literally, smoke was coming from the wires connecting the spike to the solenoid.  We used really thin guage wire to connect our solenoid to our spike.  We changed to a MUCH larger actuater today.  Before today, pneumatics worked FANTASTIC.  After the step-up in actuater size, we went to test it, and the wires between the spike and the solenoid fried.  What gauge should we use, ideally?


I think they were showing the "mysterius" black box... which is most likely empty... or evil   :eek: :D




yea, that and there bot....
If you know your absolute heading and the heading relative to a beacon, you can figure your position. or be less dependent on the value and just use the compass for Red/Blue.

But if your not doing IR, you can use it for, say, Forward(600) TurnTo(3000) Forward(42).
holy smokes!!!! thats wonderfull!!! makes my electronics look like cow dung
notice the title and the other bots in the background...
Do you have anyway of maneuvering yourself on the bar, IE swinging or a wheel that moves you from side to side.


We all know those who hang are reaching 12 feet into the air, but what is the highest point on your robot when you are hanging?
For us it is rather scary, when we are at the top of the bar we reach 22ft into the air!!  How high do your robots go.





isnt it 10 feet from the platform?
nope lol its pretty simple. there are 2 aluminum hooks that stick up past the top of our lift. we hook on and power the van door motor. where ever we are we are. i guess we could use our ball flippers to shift the center of gravity, causing us to swing, i hadnt thought about it. what would the benifit be?
Yep, we're using the same wheels and had the same problem and came up with a similar solution. There are times when high traction is great and others where it really hurts you.
Can you read it before the match? We wired a Left/Right switch on the OI to save weight. Plus, I made a cool little panel for it.

Basically, you put the code that sets the variable in user_rountines.c, and the auton code reads the variable, which would NOT be changed during auton mode because User_Autonomous_Code() has it's own loop.
**wow your robot is going to amazing, i can by the wireing. wat other regonals are you going to???**
Use the dashboard app from IFI. The OI still spits to dashboard even if you don't have the RC on. Make sure the jumper is on OI
i dont know wether or not this would work. my understanding is that the robot must be off when it is placed on the field. also, i believe that the OI must be off (well duh) before power is aplied. the power is suplied thught the compititon port. therfore, as soon as the OI is powerd, it puts the robot in disabled mode, and no data, from swtiches or joystics or whatever, is send to the RC.

so i would say nope. but i may be wrong


when the OI is in disabled mode, the robot sees it as off and no data at all is transmited or received. when it is in auton mode, it does send and recieve data, but because of the construction of the RC (i.e. 2 pics that talk to eachother) you cant get to any of the data while the auton bit is high.



That's not how it's working for me. When our competition port dongle is set to disable the robot and the yellow "disabled" light is on, communication happens as normal, and the RC sees the OI just fine. It just can't set its outputs to control the actual robot hardware.  When the dongle is set to "autonomous" and the yellow light is blinking, all data from the OI is read as default values.

I'm expecting this to be the case before a real match, so the robot can read our IO's autonomous options switches in the time before autonomous mode is activated.
That is the problem. But ship is on thursday. Show up early.
our team uses the 4 conductor 22 gauge wire that comes in the kit. i wired the red-white together and the black-ground together. this has worked perfectly. but if you were going for an ideal gague, i would say about 18, mabye 20. 16 is far to large


the balls can be put anywhere in the team area as long as they stay in there correct?



Yes, that is the way the rule is written anyways.  I would double check with the refs at your first regional though.
i think this would be worth a vistit to FIRST q&a because i know there have been at least 2 revisions to the OI - interface system sence it was released, thus the problems in DC. you may be apsolutly right, and i hope you are becasue we could eliminate a lot of confusion by getting rid of needless switches on our bot. but last year our team tried something similar and it resulted in bad stuff. like, we went barrling into the wall and got a warning for field damage :/
With "Questions only" isn't he free to ask?


notice the title and the other bots in the background...



that robot is definatly a a new one, and the other "robot" that you see in the background appears to be a ball collection device.
I use a Mac and PC. I perfer the Mac over a PC. I also own an iPod.
Hey guys. Great job on the controls. I can't wait to see how the robot matches with its controls.
It's not that, it's that the main loop has different iteration times depending on what is executed. Besides, It'd be so much cooller if we got it to work.

And like I said, just put calls to putdata and getdata in the loop.


we have the banner sensors hooked up so that every time the drill motor turns 1 revolution it clicks twice. both wheels have one. that way we can not only accuratly turn, but also compensate for errors in slipage as we know how many clicks SHOULD be per x loops and how many ARE per x loops. it works very well and i wrote easy_left_turn(time), easy_right_turn(time), hard_left_turn(time), hard_right_turn(time), drive_slow(time), drive_fast(time) functions that all have automatic slipage comensation. if i can get the code on a floppy ill be glad to post it. so far its worked perfectly




yeah like i (think i) said above, we used the banner sensors as shaft encoders and there smooth and awsome. now i just have to figure out how to hook them up to the inturpts....... .... ... oh boy

You could test if you can get control input by creating your own competition port which is in one of the innovation first documents...
In a real match, the full competion port will be used.


when the OI is in disabled mode, the robot sees it as off and no data at all is transmited or received.



Wow ...

If you don't know the answer to a question, PLEASE don't respond.

When the robot is set to disabled mode by the Operator Interface, data IS transmitted and data IS received. The ONLY thing that is different when the robot is in disabled mode is that all PWM outputs are set to 127 and all Relay outputs are set to 0. Operator Interface inputs can still be read in by the robot.

During the autonomous period, the reverse happens -- outputs function normally, but the robot sees all OI input as 0 for switches/buttons and 127 (neutral) for joystick axes and pots.

This means, YES you can put switches on the control board to choose autonomous programs and all will work wonderfully.

We used the banner sensors in this manner last year and it was awesome. Good luck. :D
Where are the "sheets" for this kinda thing? I noticed the Chatsworth box had a LOT more stuff in it then mine does, and that kinda bugged me... I had been looking for like 30-60 mins for the pinout guide for the CPT port. Could someone please direct me twords the resources they used or other people used for their comp port things?

The way they worded it suggests that


I think they were showing the "mysterius" black box... which is most likely empty... or evil   :eek: :D




i no wat the black box does, it sends out a signal to disable all the other robots and then a rele low frequency sound to have elephants come and step on all the other robots. the plow is there to push the remains of the robots off the field and the suspension is so it jus has a smooth ride over a dead robot parts.....hahaha jkjk

it looks rele nice guys.  great job, but wat is that suspension for :rolleyes:
did you deleat the assinments later on in the code? they could be overwriting your values
what's a soccer ball doing in the basket? :p
okay my bad.


Note that if you were using this as a timer, it would be different at different battery charges as the controller would run slower.



Ken was right when he said that the timer will always run at the same speed. Texan probably meant that the motors being controlled by the timer would run slower ... which is true.

Getting back to the original focus of this post ... why do you want a sleep function? If you post the reason for your request for a sleep function, you'll probably get much better help.
if your going to the point where the diffrence between 23 and 26 ms matters, then use a timer inturupt. this is not a basic stamp lol
our robot needs to go on SERIOUS diet... of course we have to take the weight off somehow... but lets finish building it first...

I think this is all the general public knows about the port:

pin 1 - VCC (note that IFI says that using this pin will void your warranty)
pin 5 - Autonomous Enable
pin 6 - Disable
pin 8 - Ground
pin 12 - Enable Channel Select
it was 145 but after a day of weight reduction its down to approximatley 130 but it looks like a school bus the way we cut the side panels
we built light this year.... and it payed off
no swiss cheese nessesary... yet.
hehe, the catalac badge is a nice tough, very very nice!


Anyone know the difference between 16 gauge wire and 10 gauge wire weights?


:D  :D  :D  :D
hehe, I just noticed they have another pic, part 2a, that they apparently didnt start a discussion on http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=6382&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose
very interesting.. and... er ... innovative design.. looks realy great! Are all the wheels driven?
Calibrate the Victors using the Victor 884 calibration procedure. Basically you hold down the calibration button on the victor with an allen wrench or other small tool while you move the joystick from center to full forward to full backward and back to center. The Victor's LED should flash green once this procedure is complete.


For those of us too lazy to read the IFI paper ... the pins to jam the paperclip into are 8 and 12.




hahaha thats counting from the left or from the right *whoops* i guess it was the other way
maybe your robot controller has managed to contract the first PICmicro virus ;)
Andy provides a clear frame that focuses our attention on the importance of the hundreds of FIRST mentors, without whom this program would not exist.

I urge the students of FIRST who are empowered to succeed, who are given the opportunity and resources to discover their passions and potential in great part because of the effort and energies of committed mentors, to take the time and acknowledge the gifts they have received, and the persons who made those gifts possible.

The act of framing a thoughtful and articulate Woodie Flowers nomination is an act of selflessness, respect and humility. It is an acknowledgement that you and your teammates understand and appreciate that FIRST is so much more about the heroes and heroines that form the fabric of our lives, and so much less about the creation of modules, mechanisms and machines that serve only as the metaphorical center of mass for the FIRST experience.

The Woodie Flowers Award is not something to be won, but rather something to be shared.

Through the act of framing a nomination, you are sharing the most important aspect of the FIRST experience; The recognition that people possess the power and passion to make a difference.

The act of recognizing the importance of a particular mentor creates a culture of graciousness, humility and respect that helps to ensure the continued support of this important ingredient of FIRST’s success; Great Mentorship!

Whatever success a FIRST team achieves would be diminished in some measure if the young people involved did not make the effort to share their gratitude and respect for an important person on their team whose commitment and energies impacted their lives….permanently, and for the better.

This award is called the Woodie Flowers Award because it celebrates the character and values of a gracious and humble person whose personal and professional achievements demonstrate that we not only possess the power and passion to make a difference but that power and passion can be clearly communicated and shared with others.

I have been familiar with the FIRST experience since 1994, and I can name dozens of men and woman whose selfless dedication and commitment, whose energy and efforts have changed so many lives for the better, more than qualify them for WFA recognition. And I don’t even know 1% of all the deserving mentors.

I am asking the young members of FIRST to recognize the importance of what these wonderful people are doing, I am asking that you set aside the time, and make the effort to share your love and gratitude by  taking the time to script a WFA nomination, and in so doing, share the wonderful gifts you have received.

Please, take the time to reflect on the importance and value of great mentorship, and then communicate your love and understanding of this cherished resource by nominating  a mentor from your team!

With my deepest respect,

Michael Bastoni
A person who was nominated by gracious and giving students, who continue to achieve wondrous success in living and giving.
I will have to go with the pc. I grew up with Windows, use it everyday, my company uses nothing but pcs so that is what I know and am comfortable with. I will say the Macs are good machines but I have limited experience on them and are somewhat lost and uncomfortable when using them. I also build my own computers, customize, and upgrade them and I also don't know of much support and vendors for doing this in the Apple world.
The pvc is great at lifting the balls and the motors do just fine. we cant drive up the stairs, our wheels are only 6 inches, but we can get up onto the platform if we use the arm. It runs like a dreamy swamp thing.  :D
nice paint!!!!
Have you tested this device with the Dashboard?


Try increasing the tire pressure.

-Kevin






just like he pointed out.... get more pressure on your tire... about 35 psi.
Any wait/pause code is the basis of a DriveForTime() Routine


what type of algorithom would you use to determin your relitive postition from logged yaw rate data? is there something obious that im missing?




yes, the sensor output is degrees per second - so if you simply accumulate the sensor output, subtracting the zero point each time (512 for the 10 bit ADC) - then what you are doing is integrating the sensor (multiplying times time)

and you end up with degrees - compass heading.

you would have to calculate the correct constant to get your register into actual degrees, based on the scaling factor of your yaw rate sensor, and how many times a second you add it to the accumulator

or you can leave it in whatever units it comes out to be, and use it as a relative number - for example, if you initialize the accumulator to 32000 and turn right 90°, the accumulator might increase to 45,000 or 52,823 (whatever) - you just need to do some  testing and see what the units come out to be - then you will know how many counts = 1°


:yikes:  :confused:  could someone who knows how to program the bot (that is comming to the ST. LOUIS regional) please program our robot.  :yikes:  we are using the default code and we have some additional things that need to be worked into the program but none of our team members know the language. :confused: anyone else that wants to help my e-mail is nickmesa2005@yahoo.com
we need programming for 1 joy stick to go forward, back, and turn with two different pmw ports (drill motors)
two different buttons to reel in cable for different things (2 seat motors)
one button to turn van door motor.
at a total we have 5 motors and need three different buttons with the
x and y axis working correctly.   thanks
**PLEASE**




nick, are the seat motors and the van motor on victors or relays?
there IS another option... shave down the wheels!! or mabye get some teflon and start wraping them... :D


Any wait/pause code is the basis of a DriveForTime() Routine



yesm. i think were arguing the same thing here.
You don't need it in degrees; just use robot units!


thank you.. 237 has been such a big help this year. first the motor mounts and now this.

Thanks!




It's called Gracious Professionalism. :)  What's even better is that we are within a half hour or less of each other.
:blink: :blink: victors, but thats another forum.

We use relays for solenoids.


There is a difference between it being easy for a human to read, and easy for a computer to understand.

Personally, I choose what is easier for me to understand, and in the 2% of cases where it needs to be fast, I write well commented assembly.




If people ask a question, I'll give easy to understand code. I just wrote that up real quick, and didn't bother to shove it in as few lines of code as possible.

As far as four lines, six lines, or two lines in ASM- this isn't ASM.

Don't worry guys...theres a big prison across the street...some great sight seeing ahead of us!
Yea, we noticed this problem back in week 2 durring our first trial run, we fixed it by putting casters on pnumatic cylinders. On carpet we are always in caster mode but when we climb or we are on the platform we are on awd mode.
I think he was asking nick_champ_2...


:blink: :blink: victors, but thats another forum.

We use relays for solenoids.




never hurts to double-check. would you dive headfirst into a programming project without knowing exactly and for sure what you're programming for?


We had that problem last year. We went through about 6 sets of gearbox before the season was over. The gearboxes are not very strong and if the spacers are not exactly right, they will break.





just want to point out that dont feel bad... last year we had to take our drive train apart 26 times during 3 competitions... our shifting tranny was underdesinged... but this year thats not happening again.... :D
Great Job!! im very happy to see antoher sucessful Rochester team!
good job this year on the robot im very impressed on your design. and good luck!


I think he was asking nick_champ_2...




that i was.
Yes. Use aliases.
er... are you ok?
no you dont need to use it, and if you do there should only be 3 wires on it - one coming from the battery

one to the buss box that takes #6 wire on one side and #10 on the other

and one to the ground stud on the small breaker box.

Its much easier to put the #10 wires on  the buss box, and on the ground pushon terminals of the smaller breaker box than to have an octapus on the ground stud.


Yes. Use aliases.




remember, this is a team that doesn't really know the language - i'd like to give them as simple a time as possible, so if i can ask a question and get a simple answer, and in doing that save both them and myself coding, why shouldn't I?
I dont think hes around, I emailed him over an hour ago and my PM is still unread...

not everyone checks the forums every hour, as much as it might seem like it to you or me ;)
I said that was me. Besides, getting aliases down would really help in the future.

I case your wondering, An alias is what we call a name we give to something, as shown here:


#define LeftMotor pwm01



That way, you can use LeftMotor in your code instead of pwm01. It makes your code more readable and reduces headache if you change the motor to pwm07.

I have a PC that I got cheap. I've worked on the best of both, played on the best of both, and surfed on the best of both (OSX, XP) and I most definatley prefer Macs. They use up so much less sytem resources, and are better all around, no crashes (or at least very very few). The general look of the mac is better, but that's not nearly close to being on my top reasons for preference. The audio and video codecs are awesome, they are generally faster (though pentium pro rules), and well Mac laptops just can't be beaten. There are so many more reasons why I prefer a mac but a combination of being tired, and knowing that most people who prefer windows will not change their mind. Because human beings in nature are creatures of habit.
im sure if FIRST gave them then they are expecting to people to use them unaltered


every "if" statment is at least 4 lines in ASM. add an "else" and that adds 6 more lines. a boolean assinment is only 2 lines. but whatever



Check out the listing of what the compiler produces. An "if" produces a bunch of assembly, but so does an assignment of bit-sized values.


I noticed the AMD vs. Intel debate spinning off this way, so let's start this up: Which do you perfer: PC or Mac? Personally I love PC and hate mac with a passion.



PC ALL THE WAY!!! :D
oh man, thats wierd, can you post a vid?
we are using a globe motor... the arm looks great... :D


Any wait/pause code is the basis of a DriveForTime() Routine




What?  DriveForTime should do some driving for a given time ... but I don't see how any waiting is implicit in the function.  Am I grossly mistaken?  You can use a timer interrupt to drive for the specified amount of time, all you do is say:


if (time_from_start < time_to_drive) { put code to drive here }
else { as you are done driving, move on to the next thing }



Where's the need to wait?  If you are 'pausing' (stuck in the loop for some reason), you sure aren't driving.  Care to elaborate your thinking on the matter?
I cannot discourage you enough not to mess with the calibration of the Victors.

Use the factory cals.  The other way lies madness!

I am serious.  Rescale your joysticks in code if you have to but I think you will be very very sorry if you start messing with the cals on the Victors.

There are lots of good reasons not to recal the Victor, but one of the best is that if you ever blow a Victor and replace it you will have to recal, and probably right before the championship round, if Murphy's Law holds.

The non-centering joystick is easy to solve in software, stay away from the Cal button on your Victors...

How did StangPS get the angle of the robot relative to the field?



Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they used the kit-provided yaw rate sensor (it's not in this year's kit). If you're using tank drive, you can also calculate this angle without the gyro, and with just the distance each side has traveled.


Ive been using belkins one since the start with no problems...




I've been using a keyspan USB -&gt; serial adapter hooked to an XBox since the begining as well.  Works great.


there IS another option... shave down the wheels!! or mabye get some teflon and start wraping them... :D



You can't very well shave down pneumatic wheels now can you?
My Suggestions (no guarantees):
Take team members, see if any relatives own/are employed by companies, even if it's big ones, like locktight or travelers, most of those companies have grant programs/you can write formally and ask for money, it really helps that they are helping an employee's relative
Also, be sure to boast your accomplishments, and tell them that you intend to continue the tradition, people like to sponors award-winning teams, any award!!

that's about as much as i can come up with
Ok, this is how you declare global variables and do definitions... When you do a constant definition, always do it in the header file (always!) do it sepreate from all other variables.
You declare the reg variables at the top of the source file and set them to their starting state if you want. If you want them to be an external you declare them in the H file the same as in the C file, but you add extern in front and DONT set the starting val
ex


//blah.c
#include "blah.h"
// our global variables
unsigned int var1 = 3;
signed int var2 = -2;
double var3 = 3.5;

// our types
OMGtype origion;
OMGtype point1;
OMGtype point2[4];

/*also you can have static vars that are not seen publicly. If you want
*you can make a sub that will return them to other source file function
*thingys. You would delcare the function globaly but only delcare the
*var inside the source C file. I wouldnet recomend this method but it
*is an option if you want to have vars that share a name in different
*source files.
*********************/
double Left_Speed; //the static (non-public) var

double Get_Left_Speed(void) { return Left_Speed; }// and then the function

void playwithtypes(void)
{
point1.blah = 3 //this is how we read/write to a structure
point2[0].blah = 4 // this is how we read/write to a structured array
}




//blah.h
#ifndef _blah_h
#define _blah_h

// defines
#define STATE1 0
#define STATE2 1
#define STATE3 2
#define LEFTMOTOR pwm01
#define RIGHMOTOR pwm02

//declare vars
extern unsigned int var1;
extern unsigned signed int var2;
extern unsinged double var3;

//declare prototype functions
double Get_Left_Speed(void);
void playwithtypes(void);

/* also you can do types which are like variables inside variables
* this is usefull if you have many different variables, all related in
* groupes. Ex coordinates
typedef struct defOMGtype
{
double blah; // for my blah variable
double x; // for my x variable
double y; // for my y variable
double z; // for my z variable
} OMGtype

// now define externals that use the structure
extern OMGtype origion;
extern OMGtype point1;
extern rom OMGtype point2[4] = { // a structured array!
/*if you want to you can define the variables here and set it as a constant
*in the rom
*********/
//blah, x, y, z
{2,3,4,6}, //array element 1 [0] //alway start at zero!

{3,5,3,2}, //array element 3 [2]

hope this helps
For 300, this law predicted the amount of data storable on a givin amount of silicon would double every year.
I implemented my own receiver and tracker code last night and today, heavily modeled after Kevin's code.  I generalized the receiver code such that all receiver interrupt pins call the same function and just pass a pointer to an ir_receiver structure which has all the necessary elements in it.

The tracker code likewise takes a pointer to a tracker structure, which in our code contains pointers to 3 receiver structures.

There were no problems re-working kevin's code to my own.  He had already structured it well enough to be a single function, not quite sure why he didn't just generalize it to being with.  I guess it's much more readable and understandable to people who aren't familiar with multiple levels of pointer dereferencing and passing.


isnt it 10 feet from the platform?



I'm not sure, it could be 12, because when our robot is fulling hanging a 5 foot 9 inch person can walk under it. Are robot is all most 5 feet tall when starting, and when it hangs from the bar, our (arm) sticks up to 22 feet in the air above the ground.;)
Looks like one of our two blck boxes, only you took the time to stick on a DB-9 rather than jst drillign holz and dangling wirz out.
Those gripper arms look awfully familliar...  :D
We bent ours out of EMT. We're using a 3 arm based grabbing system...
Team 568 Update:

Since we posted this pic, we've completely redone the ball hopper to reduce the balls sticking on the fishing line, redone the electronics board, added pneumatics (think: funnel), and we are currently working on a mechanism to grab the 2X ball (our first one used a window motor, which didnt have enough torque; the grabbing mechanism still works beautifully). Even with the 2X ball on top of the bot, we can easily hold 12 balls. We haven't quite fixed all of the kinks with balls jamming while unloading, but we still haven't used that rotary actuator... I dont think it will be an issue in competition. The only major hurdle left is the center platform :-(. I don't know that we'll be going there, but we're going to leave our options open. So, for all of you that will be there, see you in San Diego (ahh... dreams of sunshine [which we sorely lack here in Anchorage]). Adios.
yellow on program, and green on power.  Only the two are lit.

all we did was go onto the field and pick the robot off the bar (from its hanging state) and carried it off...
I've read several horror stories about judging conditions at different regionals where the animations were played amidst the noise of the pits on faulty equipment... Has anyone ever had any problems with animation judging at the Ypsilanti regional?
I'm hoping it won't be a problem because I'm particularly proud of the work team 1489's three animators have done! :D
I'm terrified
Our bots would og well together though
there was alot of evolution in our gripper. We started off with 3 fingers, 2 on top 1 on bottom, then we went to 2 on top to 1 on bottom with the bottom having rollers, then we went to the roller on the bottom, then we went to 2 on the bottom an 1 on top, then we went to the same with different combiniations of rollers, and eventualy we ended up with our current one of 2 on top 2 on bottom with rollers on the bottom... :D


the link is down?



might have been, but its working for me now.
from what i understand of the passing of the balls is you can, as long as you stay on your side of the field... considering one team has a not so good HP, and they do not want to waste balls, they can either bounce the ball over (depending on where the coaches are) or go TO the line (not over) and pass the other team the ball...

but from here... will COACHES be able to pass the ball to the other team's HP or coach??
u guys are in luck... all u need to do is read team update #9... but to save u the agony of looking i will tell u what to do.
1) Hold both the program and reset buttons.
2)Then, let go of reset
3)Wait until the power led is solid green.
4)let go of program
5) download the program
6)hit reset

You should now be set to go!
It does keep falling into the program state.

Are all the wheels driven?




Yes.
very
Well, at the DC Scrimmage last Saturday, I saw quite alot of bots w/ this problem...
Luckily ours wasnt one...
But anyway, the 12" pneumatics wheels seem to be used ALOT this year. Mainly, I would assume to climb the platform from the side, which based on last weekends results, isnt going to work quite as well as people would hope...
We personally stick with our 8x2" wheels, spaced out 26" wide (roughly)
I'm not too sure how to eliminate the issue. If you're not planning on going up the platform, try to get some smaller wheels with a little less traction. Or, you could make 2 big omni wheels for the front or back 2 tires of your bot using a bunch of smaller omnis.
I would make sure your tire pressure is full though. That was an issue with a few of the 12" 4x4 bots...


besides climbing the stairs what exactly are you trying to acomplish?




We'll post pix of our bar grabbing and climbing device tomorrow.

We also have a secret weapon which will allow us to manipulate the balls in an interesting fashion (weight allowing).
Problem easily solved.  Go to your local comp USA/Best buy/Frys/Circuit city/Microcenter/Walmart etc and buy whatever joystick you want.  ANY non-usb joystick will work.


but wat is that suspension for :rolleyes:




Climbing the 6" step.
Is tribe also going to NJ?
and no info on the black box :)
Well, what if there already running hubless sprockets?
yeah we also dont have 20 dollars each for 4 new joysticks
also, no one carries game port accesories anymore
looks as though that the balls roll out through the bottom into the corral when released.


and no info on the black box :)

is that the yaw rate sensor that came in the kop last year? ours looks bigger...
have you had any sucess programing it? i think its rs232 but i have no idea where to start in terms of an algorithom or whatnot. i just have no idea.




It's an ADXRS150 (or whatever) along with a power supply to take the battery's 12 v down to 5 v.  It is, in fact, enclosed in a radio hut project box.
The DB9 is just a convenient connector to carry power in and signal out.

Its a "gyro"/Yaw rate sensor that was created by the team.  I give this team a huge hand and commendment for coming up with a team designed use and actual yaw rate sensr this year.

I and some other members are going to St. Louis and possibly other regionals to scout teams that are going to be at Chicago and the Championship. I know that Wildstang sends scouts to events too. So I was wondering what other teams send scout to where?




Hey i got a challenge for you.  If you are goign to a competition and are not competing in it, and plan to scout...do a little more at the same time!  Find the pit admin table and ask where at the event they need help and volunteer while your there to help out.  Just think of this as giving back to something that has given you so much...
As we did last year, the Firebirds are going to the Chesapeake Regional which is the week before the Philly regional that we are registered for.  This is a great regional to attend for its great venue (Naval Acad) and great competition.  Also, there are a good number of teams going to Annapolis and Philly to give us a good idea for advanced strategy plans.
You have to make a new "paper" file, its the icon that looks like a tan paper. Then you go to place componet and find you file. You can choose the scale and such in there. Then place it where you want. You may project the drawlings to top, front, and isometric if you wish. Then on the left hand tool bar, click the gray box above the place compent thing, there should be an option to go into drawling mode or something like that. When you click on that, the icons below will change and you will see general desmsion. Then you just click on the lines and drag them out.

If you want to measure it in the actual file drawling, you can just right click and go down to measure. Click on the lines you want to measure and it will give you the distance.

Sorry I don't have Inventor infront of me so the terminlogy is off, hopefully that helped. I will have Inventor back tomorrow, if you have any questions.



Congrats to the ultimate FIRST history nerd (and now a proud owner of a 12 pack of Mountain Dew if I ever see him...Joe Ross!!!




No, the title of ultimate FIRST history nerd still belongs to the one who was able to come up with 90 questions to ask.


YES.... a chance to visit Team 25's school and see their shop.
Almost as cool as visiting Dean's place.
:D



I have actually been to NBTHS, I have never seen their shop, I don't think they build their bot there.  It is probably built off site.  Our team has a shop but we have no room so we build at a place called World Water, we have 3 mills, 2 lathes and a lot of robot parts lying around.
NJ is the place to be, we are the robot building capital, if you look at chairmans award/ National winners finalists there are a lot of NJ teams!

Our old one one was the Fab 5 because we had 3 schools and 2 sponsors. (Long before my time though)
What competitions are you guys going to?  And do you have a good HP to be able to get most of those balls in the goal?

You will be a force to be reckoned with...especially if you get paired with a robot that is able to control a 2x ball and hang.
The highest scoring bot I saw was one that parked under the ball dumb got ALL the balls, drove over to the ball chute, and deposited them all.
FIRST in past years have disallowed the use of portable sound systems and head sets in the drivers station.  At all times you must beable to hear the officals if they need to say something to you and also if your aliance wants to say something to you.  Plus this could be considered an edge if it was modified into a device that could pickup a broadcast frequency from a radio/walky-talkie device.  So in conclusion i cant find a valid rule this year yet in past years they have disallowed it, so i would reccommend your team to post it on the FIRST Q&A board.


I've read several horror stories about judging conditions at different regionals where the animations were played amidst the noise of the pits on faulty equipment... Has anyone ever had any problems with animation judging at the Ypsilanti regional?
I'm hoping it won't be a problem because I'm particularly proud of the work team 1489's three animators have done! :D




At VCU last year, animation judging was done on a small TV in the pits among all the noise and distractions, but at Arizona there was a nice place set aside in a quiet room.  So it just varies from regional to regional, I haven't heard anything about Ypsilanti's juding.

Your animation looks great guys, especially the person.  Very realistic, hope you guys do well.  :]
I apologize ahead of time for the seemingly random nature of this story.

I was walking to the store, and Joe was not saying to me, "Hey Tim, we should rob a bank or something!". I told him he was a that lunatic. He just smiles, cocks his head, and flicks me off. Some friend he is.

Anyway, we got I'm some faygo, and walked home. On the way holding we spotted three dogs and thirty two rhinos. As long as I was tapped a out I was safe, but Joe still had forty mana left. Dang. So I counter hitched up my skirt and we ran for the border.

When we got to Taco Bell, I had a burrito spell. Joe had some sushi, I think. Andy had a cow. Moo. Then I notice the or rhinos where at Dairy Queen too! Belgium, this was one ju ju flop situation! What were we to do?

So I welled up all the energy I could muster, and pinged anything the guy right in the Volvo! Zing!

...and that's what I did after school today, officer.
Some metal-core CD, with remixes of Maniac, and Sunday Bloody Sunday, and an Offspring song, and Every Rose Has It's Thorn as well as some others... I "borrowed" it for the night cause one of the girls on the team left it in my lappy CD player today while we were at the robotics meeting!

I couldn't even tell you who the artist is.
1108 went to St louis to watch last year and it made a major difference to how we did things.  This helped us to definitely when both the LSR and championship rookie all-star and the team spirit award.  It also gave us good strategy which probably gave us a competitive advantage at our regional, which we won.  I know they are planning to take the drive team the STL again this year.  One of the parents has family on the Illinois side so he take the team members and gets a chance to go home to see his parents.
Oh, you MADE one. Im guessing to keep the cost down. We were going to go with an old first yaw/rate on our bot, but we made an accelorometer for under $10, then we decided that there was no reason to use it... Are you using it for ajusting your "legs" while climbing?
I wonder how many of these posts have been just a statement with a question mark attached to them?:D


Problem easily solved.  Go to your local comp USA/Best buy/Frys/Circuit city/Microcenter/Walmart etc and buy whatever joystick you want.  ANY non-usb joystick will work.




That's not true. Many newer gameport joysticks do not follow the gameport standard. If the box says windows only (or doesn't mention dos) in the system requirements, then it probably won't work.

Another indication that it probably won't work is if it has more then 8 switches or more then 4 analog inputs.  Another is that is has a "pass through" to allow you to connect multiple joysticks to it.
Our team also has a "kitchen" and "garage". The kitchen is for people who screw up. And the garage is for people who don't. Currently I and our teachers are in the kitchen. I broke the robot and LeGate is in for good for numerous things. Franzenburg is in for saying May instead of March for Chicago on ***LIVE*** television.


I've been using a keyspan USB -&gt; serial adapter hooked to an XBox since the begining as well.  Works great.




Question: Does it work on Macs?


You DID download the default code, right?




Following up with this, are you using the default code, or your own code? Does it occur with the default code?
It's a pity that this pic masks the true beauty of my electronics board... Like the capitan said, after we mounted the rubberized-belty thing on the schooper (the mechanism that scoops up the balls) we had no problem loading 10-12+ balls in the bot. Those fp motors may not look like much, but with the transmission they can sure torque the rubber balls.
The mechanisms mounted on the side swing out to herd the balls in for collection. I *think* those are in the process of being redesigned for less weight. Just for kicks, has anyone had trouble with the plastic gearboxes breaking? They arent a big deal to replace, but with bots going up and, more importantly, down that 6" lip, I think we may see some of those breaking under the force of a falling 130 lb bot, esp for arm bots that drop off the bar AFTER competition. Recommendation, use double solenoids! Its a pity that eveyone is going for the bar; I don't know that anything but the last 10-15 seconds will be very interesting in many games. FORWARD THE BALL COLLECTORS!!!


Does anyone happen to have a team roster for the championship event in Atlanta. If anyone does could you post it here or email it to me at [email]Aggresive05@aol.com[/email]. Please thank you.




no one except FIRST now should have a list of the teams that wil be attending the Championship event.  Check the [Championship page](http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/chevents.htm) @ FIRST daily to see if they release the lists.  Normally this is done in March and it is listed with devision listings.

In 8.2.4 of the manual:

"A panel of judges will
review the Chairman’s Award entries at each Regional and will conduct on-site Chairman’s Award interviews
with those teams who have entered a submission for that regional event."
We can stick up by as much as 3 feet above the bar when hanging.
hope you're not planning on using it this year -
Yaw/Gyro from last year is not allowed - read the Q&A

we played with the idea of using it before the kick off but had to shelve the idea


I believe that 5 weeks seems to be the stress point for a lot of teams. It seems like no matter who you are, after 5 weeks, you start argueing and stressing with everyone on your team. It's innevitable.



But, do you think that it is a time factor, or just because that in the 5th week, we are almost done, but not quite there and that usually is the beginning of tweaking and you really just want it to work perfectly, but the little things just seem to set you back for days or hours which are unwanted?

Do you think if we had 5 weeks that the 4th week would lead to the same thing?
I think he's talking about animation...
It's official, 384 will be staying at the *gasp* Omni. Wether Mr. JoeM will be attending, is still unknown, and if I do, look for some safety measures in place to keep various people out of my room and try to kill me.  ;)  :p


Where'd you get the Jolt?

They never have any at Wal-Mart.



7-11 never fails to have a steady supply of Jolt, along with all them drinks with Taurine, like AMP.


We all know those who hang are reaching 12 feet into the air, but what is the highest point on your robot when you are hanging?
For us it is rather scary, when we are at the top of the bar we reach** 22ft into** the air!! How high do your robots go.




the bar is defently 10 feet off the ground, and 9 feet off the platform why would you be reaching 12 feet in the air.  22ft is rediculus what purpose could that possable serve???
This is the list as of now:

Does the mysterious black box contain a board with a MEMS yaw rate sensor, or is there an actual homemade sensor in there?
As far as getting ideas goes, you're in luck! Chief Delphi has a whole [fundraising forum](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=63) set up.

Hopefully you can pull some good ideas from there! :)
you can get gyro sensors from the catalogs - analog devices make great ones that you can get on tiny little exal boards - all you need to do is attach +5V, gnd and the signal wire.

search on 'yaw' or 'gyro' and you will find the threads with the parts listed.
It says you'll be judged at each attended regional.

The divisions won't be released for a while, though, as Dez said.

Edit: Ricky beat me to it.
If it's too open and easy to short, even when covered with electrical tape, shouldn't we remove all of the rest of the electrical components too?  I don't see how it's different...
That sounds very similar to what we're doing. We used a Radio Shack project box (albeit an aluminum one) housing an Analog Devices ADXRS150EB yaw rate sensor and a Motorola MMA1201 accelerometer. Instead of using a connector, we used nylon cable grips from Digi-Key along with shielded cable to provide strain relief and good shielding without risking the addition of additional noise from a connector. The power supply (7812 regulator, voltage divider, diodes, and 7805 regulator) is housed in a separate enclosure. Yours looks a lot neater and less unwieldy than ours; I hope it works well.
Last year we had that problem at competition, but that was because we were rammed in the side in the middle of a match.
Yes I'm talking about animation... that's why it's in the Animation forum..  :rolleyes:

Thanks for the reassurance Matt, I just wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.
I used this last year, and I don't think it has changed at all.  What you do is you grab the values of the OI autonomous selection switch while the robot is disabled before the autonomous period.  Then you store it for later use.  Works great.
That is kinda odd that u 4 wanna get in there but i think i know why Arefin and Michele are in the bottom, together. But ne ways that looks like a cool crate the guy who designed it must be ten times cooler, he should win an award or somethin. :D

I find that 7 weeks' good enough for me. With over 12 hrs at school, it can be really stressful at some times. Also, having only 5 - 6 hours every day for 5 weeks' will push a lot of people to the breaking point. We've spent around two days trying to decide what we could and taking off weight on the robot (I would like to see them extend the weight limit though!). Our IR may not work just yet, and autonomous mode does not look to be perfected until our second regional like last year's...
Wow,

Amazing job on the bot. Exactley how i would have imagined one. Hope you' ve got your H.P.'s trained up for comp. They seems to be a big aspect this year as addresed at kickoff. With your team especially. Good luck, hope to see you at Nat's. :D
I think the problem that they have though is that the 'center' is sooo far off that they are losing some resolution.  If the center was at 135 instead of 127; it's not that big a deal.  But, when they are talking 190 something being a neutral then the joystick becomes very sensitive; even with scaling.

What specific things have been observed with the recal of Victors that is negative?

You can get the list of current teams signed up for the championship by going to the regionals page, then viewing the event capacity, and then clicking team list for the championship. http://www.usfirst.org/frc/map/FMPro?-db=team%20events.fp5&-lay=web&-format=team_list.htm&event=CMP&event%20year=2004&status=signed%20up&-sortfield=team%20id&-max=all&-find

The divisions won't be released for a while, though, as Dez said.

Edit: Ricky beat me to it.




Yeah i was just scrollng through the FIRST site and found out that firt does have it up via the map by clicking on Georgia but yeah you 2 beat me also.  I know when the list of devisions is released, i will try to get it up into a spread sheet so its easier to read then last years site.
The sites look very good at the ones I looked at.  Take a look at ours, the website group has spent a lot of time and it is better than last years.  Also give us your comments, as this is our second year.

www.pantherrobotics.com

Hope to see several of you at Lonestar and Nationals.
someone posted earlier that they painted the back wheels with poly somthing or another.  the robot will rotate around the front wheels because the back ones slip.


also with the tire pressure deflate the front ones and inflate the back ones.  you want it to rotate around one wheel set and slide the other.

we just stuck some casters on the back that come up when we are climbing the platform
We stick up above the bar as we are hanging by only 1.5" at the most I believe.
:D

You may want to rethink that 22' mark.. Certain fields in certain arena's may not be able to accomodate that reach.
Just a thought..
thats why this year we went with the aluminum bearing mounts
could you post a pic i want to see a robot with a 22' arm thats not tipping over

maybe you ment 22 inches???
Scooter, where did u get these modules? I'd like to get something thats already tested to work by somebody else. :D  thanks




We use a set of wireless 232 modules to get data back via the programming port.  The only modification you need to make is you have to change the UART boud rate to 19.2k instead of 115k.

Somoene actually suggested using a wax type substance like armor-all on the tires?  Would that work, or be legal?
I Have some good news and bad news.

The good news is I'm creating a 2004 FRC Team Roster.

What it will have is each team will have a link leading to FIRSTs Yearbook info. (Team Name and Sponsor Rookie Year Robot Name etc.) On that page there is a link leading to the Teams Website if any. This link is generally located on the bottom of that page.

The bad news is I just realized that many teams have paragraphs of Sponsors / Schools. What I will be doing is editing this info slightly. Due to the fact that If I was to keep 100% of the info it would take too much page width and I wanna conserve as much as I can.


Right now I have a 2003 uploaded, I will updeta the 2003 to a 2004 roster.

The page is best viewed at 1024x768 and possibly 800x600

A Downloadable version will also be made available via my website and chiefdelphi.

This will take some time and patience give me to the end of the week . It should be done by then!
Alright, I'm going to try to cover all questons/comments poster here.



*Is that a 1-roller system? How fast does it work? Good job on the bot.*




No we have multiple rollers, look for a pic of our drive and roller system later.



*My question is are you going to park right under the player station at the beginning of the match, and if you do that how will you trigger the release of the balls during Autonomous Mode??*




Yes we are planning on goign under the players station at the beginning.  We do have an alternate uato mode incase needed.  However my poll that I posted shows that 60% of the teams that chose a main auto mode, chose goign for bonus ball ( http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25380 ).  If the release isnt triggered, we'll either wait or go and do somethign abd come back at the 35 sec mark.



*Also, don't forget to watch out for the DQ of breaking the imaginary line between the playing field and the ball corral *




Our bot doesn't fit into the corral, and I hope I don't find a way to put it in there.



*wow thats amazing are you using pnumatics or motors to move the... bucket?*




Pnumatics with "cables" (to hold the top part in place).



*Question: What is at the bottom of the 'bucket' to protect the robot and itself from the impact of 18 balls?*




There is proper shrowding to protect the impact, no damnage is done. Beneigh the bucket it our frame with our ball collector and drive.



* I like it, it's nice to see the old team coming up with new tricks. I'll see you all in St. Louis. Who knows, maybe we'll be working together. *




It will be good to see you in St. louis.  Maybe the rookies (me) can teach the verteran's something  :p .



*I'm glad you guys have had such success, maybe I'll see you guys at nationals again and have late nights playing poker and driving seguways! lol*




YES!!! That was a ton of fun! Go in between (I mean we would never gamble at all on a school trip).



what else can u guys do?? amazing.




We are able to collect balls, also we are planning on being able to grab the goal.



*Ya know, when the concept was first brought up I thought, "Neat idea, but I don't think you have enough weight to work with to do that." But you pulled it off!! *

Very, very cool guys! I can't wait to see it in action!!  [/quote]





Thanks KT, I wish you could be here with us, I miss you!



*looks as though that the balls roll out through the bottom into the corral when released.*




Like I said above, we have a ball collector beneigh that where our balls will come out as well, so they won't fall out.



*What competitions are you guys going to? And do you have a good HP to be able to get most of those balls in the goal?

You will be a force to be reckoned with...especially if you get paired with a robot that is able to control a 2x ball and hang.*




We are going to St. Louis, Midwest, and the championship.  We are hoping for a bot that can atleast go for the bonus ball and hang from the bar.  I wish we had to weight to put on a hanger, however 2 years ago we won the quality award for a bot that used the KISS principle, and I think we can do that again.

Our hp today shot 46 for 46 in less than a minute and a half that includes bending down for the balls and picking them up for himself.

Thanks to everybody that posted, any more questions keep asking.  Look for more pictures soon.
mhmmmmm well i can say that our robot can that from happening however i do not want to play you at all.  Nothing is beyond our reach (2000 saying) :D opps that was a hint


I beat you! 42 hours in 4 days! (Friday through Monday)




HAH! Working on animation over president's day weekend: 68 hours in 4 days (and two of those were 24 hours of animation)


More reasons:
Falling asleep on the ramp (2003) because it looks comfortable

Organizing a weekend around getting 2-hour breaks for sleep during renders

babysitting your mentor's daughter and taking her to play on the 2003 ramp instead of the park because it's more fun

You forget the day of the week but not the status of the robot

you get 6 hours of sleep a day and it's called school

"It's the day after the thirteenth. I'm not sure what number that makes it" 'nuff said

"Please contact us when we can think in straight lines" too much said

You spend enough time soldering that you get high off the fumes

When you spend so much time soldering that you feel cold when you stop

When you know the location to get every part in the kit

When you use the animation computers as heaters

when 4 of your 5 boyfriends have been on FIRST teams

when you have your annual team hairdying outside in front of your robotics classroom

when you spend months planning hairstyles to have at competition
when you plan to spike 1.5 foot long hair

when you have a list of over 500 quotes from robotics team members
when you can quote over half of said list

when you go to other classes while wearing your safety glasses

when your cell phone has more parts companies than people on the contacts list

(collected from many GRT people)

few more...
When you ask the robot to sadies
When you ask the animation to sadies

When you contemplate making a weight loss video about your robot ("I lost 20lbs in 3 days!")


I will be surprized if you see very many people passing balls or tossing them to each other.

Why toss it to the other human player when you can toss it into the goal in less time? (you dont have to wait for the goal to look at you so you can toss it :^)




In the likely event that your own ball chute is blocked, you would want to consider passing balls to your alliance partner so they can help shooting.


Somoene actually suggested using a wax type substance like armor-all on the tires? Would that work, or be legal?



yes, anything to reduce the friction

there is another post about this(by me) but it ended up in the pnuematics section sence i said pnuematic wheels HA!

UGH!!! but on the up side i finnally have time to concentrate on school and the team =D


Send it through the Q&A system, and see what FIRST has to say about our little dilemma.




From the Q/A system:
Section: 4.4.3    Status: Answered    Date Answered: 1/13/2004
Q: If a team is attempting to uncap a goal and the opposing alliance throws a small ball at the goal at the same moment and it bounces off the large ball while the robot was still holding it, would that team be considered to be goal-tending?

A: Yes, you are goal tending if the goal you are attempting to cap or uncap is one of your opponents goals and the large ball interferes with a thrown ball with the potential to go in the goal (referee's judgement). See the definition of GOAL TENDING.

So I would say they would probably call it goaltending, but as they say above - referee's judgement.  Whether the goal is already capped or not, a small ball still has the potential to go in... If you have a field setup, try it and see if you get a ball to stay.  I've been able to.
My team did/is doing the same thing. Only we're not quite finished yet. :yikes: I hope ours works as well as yours seems too.


mhmmmmm well i can say that our robot can that from happening however i do not want to play you at all.  Nothing is beyond our reach (2000 saying) :D opps that was a hint




Well either this means that you block corrals or you block bonus ball.  Or could it be something else. If it is one of those two I think that we'll be alright.
Why do you suppose FIRST would want to enhance the sales of the relatively inexpensive spikes?
I think he meant a total of 22 ft in the air.  Even that doesnt make too much sense, you could have a 12 foot arm and winch yourself all the way to the top, but why winch so high and why have such a long arm?  Also, why is everyone at least 12 feet in the air who hangs?  If you have a hook you could just be the width of the hook (&lt;1" for us) above the bar.


Why do you suppose FIRST would want to enhance the sales of the relatively inexpensive spikes?



In fact, they may very well be decreasing overall sales by selling less victors as team use less motors.


Things heard around Montclair Robotic's shop these past few weeks:

"Can we fill the tires with Helium?"





We have had a couple discussions on this in the past week... Just for the cool factor though... Cause we are under weight right now.

It was a good idea until one of our brilliant seniors explained that the helium molecules were smaller than the little holes in our wheels...

Oh well...
tired


Yo, Daver... happy freakin birthday. ;)
See you in a few weeks.






Hey Freakin that you johnny!

Although there are easy ways to make the processor "pause" or "wait" as described above, they are probably not the best way to implement this function on the IFI Controller. The Master processor expects to receive a data packet from the user processor every 26.2ms.

This means you cannot pause the controller for longer than 26.2ms at a time and still have the control system function.

The best bet is to increment a counter every time a new data packet is received from the master processor. If you need finer control than that, use a timer interrupt.
I'm sure the profit margin on both of them is astronomical.

i see you labled your spikes and such too. always a good idea
I will spare you the awful profanities that escaped my mouth when I saw this. But suffice to say that this is the nicest arm that I have ever seen.

I was expecting good things from 857, but nothing quite like this
hey do you have some extra victors and spikes all ready mounted on there just so you have to switch cables if one fails, or do you not have them all wired yet?
Very cool guys, good luck in competition.


that is pure awsomness... so nice... just... NICE!!! lol... this kid is awsome! haha



Why thank you!!  And thank you Jay.


I've found that I do much better in shooting when I am listening to my music, and I was wondering, even though I doubt it, but will we be able to wear headphones while we are shooting balls?






No.

how far can the turret rotate?
As was stated earlier, we didnt save the footage. Our goal wasnt to save every second of footage, but to alow teams to see it live.  Last year we uploaded several files that were a couple hundred megs, then people started to download them and it locked up our server. We will take a look at what we have and try to edit some good clips from it, but you have to give us some time- As we are pretty burned out-  (We do the Animation stuff too!!!)
Thanks for your interest-
the gearboxes that FIRST provides, whiel adequate for some purposes, are plastic and as such, are prone to being broken quite easily. Those gearbox housing were designed for use with the helical gears provided in the kit, and helical gears, while not putting as much of a load on the gears themselves, exert huge forces on the actual gearbox housing. it is not wise to put those kinds of loads on a plastic gearbox housing.
that is one kick @$$ logo rage lol  :yikes:


I am only concerned in the situation where it satisfy the following condition:

1.  GOALTENDING – A ROBOT cannot interfere with a SMALL ball on its downward flight toward a goal or within a goal.

2.  &lt;G21&gt; **While a ROBOT is holding a LARGE Ball, that ball will be considered an extension of the ROBOT.**

3.  &lt;G20&gt; ROBOTS cannot GOALTEND either the Mobile or Stationary Goals. If a ROBOT GOALTENDs or de- SCORES any SMALL ball, the referee will throw a green penalty flag and the opponent’s final score will be increased by twice the value of that SMALL ball.

Goaltending only happens when a ROBOT interfer with a small ball on its doward flight toward a goal or within a goal.  When the robot is holding a large ball, the large ball is a part of the robot.  When the robot ISN'T holding a large ball, it ISN'T a part of the robot.





and what if the robot holds a small ball in its gripper and blocks a shot with it?
very nice arm  :)  good luck!!
Impressive and formidable looking!! Good luck..and happy four more days for improvement!  :)
Are those really zip ties on your wheels? :ahh:


and what if the robot holds a small ball in its gripper and blocks a shot with it?



Assume goaltending... Doesn't matter whether your robot interferes or any ball your holding interferes with their thrown ball's downward flight with the potential to go in, I believe it's all considered goaltending.
We do the actual lifting with a Van Door motor....but we position our hook with the lift motor.

I think our system is pretty straight forward.....but I have a question. Does the VAN door motor have a thermal overload protection PTC in it? Does anyone have the specs on it, and how it cuts out. (vs load?)

Thanks,

We had a practice competition today in Los Angeles.  Our robot and another robot controlller had problems freezing up in program mode when using a USB to series converter.

I believe it might have something to do with what you did with the FIRST that is causing you the issues, becuase RAGE was given permission to modify the logo as shown [here.](http://www.geocities.com/j2005k3/index.html) We are using this desing for our Tenth anniversary shirts and our new Hooded sweatshirts. So as long as the changes aren't to do with things such as the way you have FIRST and then the sm it will probably be approved.



Reminds me of a little diddy I did in 3ds max a while ago

http://trashed20.resnet.mtu.edu/firstrip.jpg

The rip was animated, and the camera moved around, but basic concept.

Very cool logo ;)


Are those really zip ties on your wheels? :ahh:




yep they are, but we're not sure if they're legal or not. We've asked numerous times about the legality of it but no one has answered us :confused:
Steel 60-tooth sprocket for #35 chain as delivered straight from the vendor, with honkin' big solid steel hub: **weight 34 ounces**.

Steel 60-tooth sprocket for #35 chain, following some lathe-enabled surgery to remove the hub and some milling to add some decorative "negative space" (i.e. lightening holes): **weight 7.6 ounces**.

Four sprockets on the robot, net weight reduction of 97.6 ounces.

Time required: about an hour per sprocket on a manual lathe and mill (or a similar amount of time with a strong-willed rookie team member armed with a hack saw and a lot of blades :) )

Cost of removing 6.1 pounds from the robot: priceless.

In other words, there is a lot of weight in the way, just waiting to be cut away and removed from your robot.  You are likely to realize larger weight savings with this method that by replacing the chains (or, if you are in really bad shape, you may need to do both).

-dave
Just reading this thread makes you realize how many possible interpretations could be in the rules...
I think that the judges will call anything that blocks a shot on the downward descent as "goal tending" including if it's with a small ball.  Small balls don't take up much space anyway...so I don't know why you'd be holding one up there, but sure, if you wanted to.  :confused:
But chances are they'll rule on the conservative side, and say it's goal tending.


No. There were a few teams that went up the 6" step, but it was much slower than the tiny stairs. Ther were also alot of teams that attempted going up the 6" step but didn't make it.

All the hanging bots had some sort of arm that extended up with a hook on the end. [Like this](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/pages/96_JPG.htm) [and this.](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/pages/236hang_JPG.htm) Both of those were on the platform when they reached for the bar.
There was one robot that tried reaching from the carpet (178). When then hooked the bar and started putting weight on their hook, [it snapped off.](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/crappy/pages/DSCN0754_JPG.htm)



Thanks Ogre!!
you might be referring to the previous years' program CopyCat, which was designed by some team (forget which), and recorded a sequence of moves, then playing them back.... don't know if there's something like that this year.
Probably the reason for 3-4 feet above the bar is so that your robot can reach the bar either from the 6" platform or from the ground.
I took one look at that picture and realized that that robot looked very familiar.  I went to my pics that I took at the St. Louis regional and found your robot and found out why it looks familiar. It is very similar to last year's robot but this year's isn't purple.   :)   You must have liked that design.

I dunno if this on here and I don't have the time to read 43 pages  :cool: but tons of people I know always get from electrical to stripping :/ its like "I was stripping" and then everyone realizes and stops... so some guys turn it into a pick up line and are all "So you need to practice stripping? Want to in front of me?"   Always fun when they're kidding :)
yeah, but getting a full twelve feet above the bar? seems like overkill and an excuse to have your robot tip over and/or fall.
give me a minute I will look at somthing


We just finished uploading our animation, and when we tried to send the email to [email]first.entry@autodesk.com[/email] we keep getting it returned.  We've tried several times now with no luck.  Anyone else having the same problem?  Has the email address been changed?  How important is the notification email for animation to be accepted?

Hope someone can help, thx in advance.





that is probably because the correct address is [email]first.entries@autodesk.com[/email]
lol ;)


I've read several horror stories about judging conditions at different regionals where the animations were played amidst the noise of the pits on faulty equipment... Has anyone ever had any problems with animation judging at the Ypsilanti regional?
I'm hoping it won't be a problem because I'm particularly proud of the work team 1489's three animators have done! :D




U will be in luck!!

Our team (74) won last year at Great Lakes.  We got to see the room where the judging was done, even though we didn't go to the regional as a team.  (we went to see the competition as a drive team).  They have seperate room away from the pits that had a nice TV and a couple rows of chairs.  Your animation will be showcased.  Don't worry about bad conditions....and from the looks of it, your team might win the ROOKIE ANIMATION AWARD.  That's some sweet stuff that you have there.  Good job!
Not totally familiar with Premiere, Its been several yrs since using it last.  I would think you should be able to sekect a different codec when you export and Cinepac should be ther my default.

ASSUMING YOU STILL CAN"T FIND IT THERE--

1)Save it as uncompressed Quicktime-
2)load it as a Background image in 3DS Max (I believe that in the Environment Tab of the Render Menu)
3)Render the Scene as is and save it as a Quicktime (again) but Max should definately give you the Output options that Autodesk asked for.

(Basically you use Max to recompress the footage- this is a great way if you dont have other software)

If you have Adobe AfterEffects- this could be used as well.

If you still cant do it- Reinstall Quicktime form MAX Disk

Goodluck


*plays the clip about ten times*

*wonders if Blondie can drag people, too*




Just to see if he could, ED-5 has also been dragging two people around at a time (but we don't have it on film).

HAHAHAH - i like it ;) sounds like dead reckoning if i ever heard of it :)




More like inertial navigation - which, as it happens, is what we're using during autonomous mode. We're planning to memorize the entire thing so we can recite it if anyone asks us about our autonomous capabilities. :D
Please dont tell me there are holes in your battery there. :ahh:
I realize this thread is not about goaltending, but this is where a discussion of the topic seems to be taking place.  The problem now appears to be figuring out what "a thrown ball with the potential to go in the goal" means.  And there will certainly be many interpretations of what could go in.

Will any ball on a downward arc that impacts a robot automatically be goaltending?  What about a ball lobbed in the general direction of a goal that, if it had not impacted a robot, would have fallen short?  Will it be possible to have goaltending called by simply throwing a ball at an opposing robot?  This last action has been suggested as a strategy in other threads in this forum.  If that is possible, so much for gracious professionalism!
151 is gonna be at the Omni.


They use up so much less sytem resources




Uhh.. what!? :)  OSX is pretty resource-heavy.  Well, you can turn off all the super-fancy stuff and really strip it down.. but then it's not pretty! :D

I don't think the Omni is gonna have anyone staying besides Robotics people, they should just rename it The FIRST Hotel.


We finally hooked up our drive system today, and we can only go about 2 feet before the treads fall off the wheel. The treads are flat on aluminum rollers and they have no grove. We have a pulley that's flanged and 2 other flanged rollers (one in the front and one in the back).

The flanges are about .1 inches, and the rollers/sprockets are 2 inches wide.

Are we totatlly screwed? Or is there anythign we can do?

Would attaching circular plates onto the flanged wheels to make a really big flange do anything?

Help plzz!!!




Ohh, do we feel your pain!  Sounds exactly like our experience last year, which was ugly enough to make us swear off treads.  The problem is that as you start to turn, the side forces are pushing the treads across the face of your pulleys, and into the flanges.  The side force is strong enough that one of three things has to happen (we went through them all):
- the tread climbs up the flange, and off the pulley (if the tread is loose enough)
- the tread rips and tears on the edges of the flange (if it is too tight to climb up the flange)
- the tread crushes the shape of the flanges and makes them useless (if the treads are very tight and the flanges are weak or damaged)

None of these are good conditions, and all of them will cause the robot mobility system to sieze up and stall.  At this point, it is a virtual certainty that you will not be able to get new treads with self-centering ridges on the back (which is what you really need to use), unless you are incredibly lucky and can find a team with a spare set.  Short of that, here are a few suggestions:

- make sure the "line" of your treads is bowed down.  In other words, look along the area where the treads make contact with the floor.  Ideally, the ends of the treads should be slightly higher than the middle (like a flatter version of the rocker on a rocking chair).  This puts most of the weight of the robot near the center of the contact patch, where the side forces from scrubbing the treads during a turn are the smallest.  This allows the ends of the treads (potentially where the side forces are greatest) to "float" a little and hopefully reduce the side forces.

- increase the size of the flanges.  This will help, up to a point (if your treads are too loose they will still climb up the taller flanges and thereby increase drag on your drive motors as the tread material scrubs against the larger surface area of the flange).

- make sure you have sufficient tension on your treads.  Again, this will help, up to a point (if they are too tight, the increased loading on your pulley bearings will result in extra friction in the system, and potentially could fail the bearings).

- can you convert to wheels in the next four days?  If the above suggestions don't help enough, you need to take a serious look at this option.  I have seen teams completely re-build their drive system in two days, so know that it can be done.

Good luck!

Actually we may or may not have to use all of those. We just hooked all the victors up in case one victor failed, we could just switch the cables to one of the other unconnected ones. The spikes were just there cause we thought it looked pretty.  :D
Our team has a panel of 3-4 people, including 1-2 mentors, a graphics team member, and a leadership member.

They observe everyone who wants to drive and operate. Their decision is based upon skills and rules knowledge. The human player is choosen based on shooting consistency.

Last year we had a Freshman as our primary driver (granted he was short, so it was hard to see across the field, but he did a great job!)


My Suggestions (no guarantees):
Take team members, see if any relatives own/are employed by companies, even if it's big ones, like locktight or travelers, most of those companies have grant programs/you can write formally and ask for money, it really helps that they are helping an employee's relative
Also, be sure to boast your accomplishments, and tell them that you intend to continue the tradition, people like to sponors award-winning teams, any award!!





This is great info. Also, if you need info like: Team Bylaws, Contracts, Policies, Org Charts, etc, fire me an e-mail: [email]PC@BPRobotics.com[/email]

Are there any medium to large companies that are HQ'd in your town? Call them and ask about community sponsorship or granting programs. Some of our best sponsors have been picked up with a cold phone call.


I don't think the Omni is gonna have anyone staying besides Robotics people, they should just rename it The FIRST Hotel.




If I am correct, they have a hotel-wide free wifi network. Maybe one of the team's tech people will start a FIRST IRC network ;-)

Granted we will probably all be talking somewhere... But it would be very cool!
I still don't understand how the f*** you put all those solenoids so close and had the outputs come out the bottom. :confused:  Please enlighten me.
what do you do if the balls get dropped before you are deployed?

I'm not trying to suggest that any robot capable of driving in a straight line during autonymous mode could render your primary function moot, just that... oh wait, that is what I'm suggesting.

Ohh, do we feel your pain!  Sounds exactly like our experience last year, which was ugly enough to make us swear off treads.  The problem is that as you start to turn, the side forces are pushing the treads across the face of your pulleys, and into the flanges.  The side force is strong enough that one of three things has to happen (we went through them all):
- the tread climbs up the flange, and off the pulley (if the tread is loose enough)
- the tread rips and tears on the edges of the flange (if it is too tight to climb up the flange)
- the tread crushes the shape of the flanges and makes them useless (if the treads are very tight and the flanges are weak or damaged)

None of these are good conditions, and all of them will cause the robot mobility system to sieze up and stall.  At this point, it is a virtual certainty that you will not be able to get new treads with self-centering ridges on the back (which is what you really need to use), unless you are incredibly lucky and can find a team with a spare set.  Short of that, here are a few suggestions:

- make sure the "line" of your treads is bowed down.  In other words, look along the area where the treads make contact with the floor.  Ideally, the ends of the treads should be slightly higher than the middle (like a flatter version of the rocker on a rocking chair).  This puts most of the weight of the robot near the center of the contact patch, where the side forces from scrubbing the treads during a turn are the smallest.  This allows the ends of the treads (potentially where the side forces are greatest) to "float" a little and hopefully reduce the side forces.

- increase the size of the flanges.  This will help, up to a point (if your treads are too loose they will still climb up the taller flanges and thereby increase drag on your drive motors as the tread material scrubs against the larger surface area of the flange).

- make sure you have sufficient tension on your treads.  Again, this will help, up to a point (if they are too tight, the increased loading on your pulley bearings will result in extra friction in the system, and potentially could fail the bearings).

- can you convert to wheels in the next four days?  If the above suggestions don't help enough, you need to take a serious look at this option.  I have seen teams completely re-build their drive system in two days, so know that it can be done.

Good luck!

-dave




unfortunately that's kind of what i expected  :(

We might try to do wheels, although i don't know how do-able that is. It was designed to be pretty much exactly the right size and deviation in height will cause us not to reach the bar, deviation in size will make us too big and be disqualified, or too small and not fit subsystems... etc.

would it help if we could get the wheels and pulleys perfectly flat or in-line? Right now they are probably within a tenth of an inch, but we could probably do it within a 100th or even less error, if it made a difference.

Thanks for the help.

We might end up trying to adapt our system to wheels but it would a last resort.
I also suggested this to my team at the beginning of the year, they thought it was not possible to hold all the balls with out falling over... I should show them your video. Great Job can't wait to see you guys at Nats.

-Aaron
Just 22 feet?? Pshhaw, we can get FIFTY-two ;)
so basically, the only way to stop you guys would be to wack off YOUR bonus ball before you can get in position.  and to do that a robot would need an autonomous mode that takes less than a second or so. ouch.
We will be staying at the [Hilton Atlanta](http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/index.jhtml;jsessionid=R5USKG4BY11L0CSGBIWM22QKIYFC5UUC?ctyhocn=ATLAHHH) .
Supposedly it's so close to the Georgia dome that we can walk there every day.
Same here we kept fogetting little things that turned into big things. On one round our arm would not open or close because we forgot to tighten a set screw, the next match we forgot the radio and the next match we could not find our driver, so we decided to leave. All of these mistakes cannot happen at VCU and I will make sure of that.
Can't wait untill VCU.

Always,

Team 836


We are a *very* rookie team, but I think the website is pretty good.
[http://wwhsrobotics.tk](http://wwhsrobotics.tk)






That is a very good site. The content is great and the flash intro cool. ^_^

The only problem I saw was the light blue on the white. I was straining my eyes to see the text in that color.
449 did well, one of two to make the chinup there!
A question about the competition box- The ones on the field didnt work, and we had to use dongles. The dongle we had aparently did not work, but it was made with the diagram on the IFI site. Can someone with a dongle that worked in DC tell me their pinout?

I also thought it was interesting that only like 2 teams brought teather cables. We forgot, the team next to us forgot, and we had many people ask to borrow one. Oh well.
I had known that some broke last year, but this year we were provided with "laser cut" spacers. Would have thought they'd help.
Did you see the update about the incorrect value of the resistor included with the beacon kit. I dont remember what to replace it with though, you will have to check on that. Also, try moving it into an open space where there isnt much for the ir to reflect off of.
Yes, the van door motor does have thermal overload protection: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2371 and http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11135

What is your gear ratio/winch diameter on the van door motor? We are able to lift at a reasonable speed without coming close to stalling the van door motor.
Are you DQ'ed if you turn in paperwork but no final animation? The dorms at our school couldn't get online, and now we have no SFX to use... I'd like to be able to be a rookie team next year, but for some reason I don't see that being the case.
Just don't include blah.h in blah.c
I believe there is, but it's really deep. Search for CopyCat.


It is very similar to last year's robot but this year's isn't purple.




Yes, it bears a strong resemblance to our last robot (The Velvet Fog), but this one has more suspension (obvious reasons).  Actually, it has more of just about everything.   ;)
hu? what are you talking about :) BTW, you can include the first code and it will automaticy exclude the rest ex
sorry that this is off topic and everything but...

there ball is teal =D


make sure your RC is perminatly mounted and is not "set in" as it seems to be in that photo.




As I said, the components are in a bit of a mess as we were changing things around. The side wings are brought out by a pulley system involving a globe motor and fishing line and elastic that pulls them back end. And we're probably going to make another arm or two, for replacements. We could probably make that entire telescoping arm in 30 minutes. that's the wonder of pvc  :)
BTW, it's not usually that messy, and we have plexiglass and diamond plate to cover the electronics. We're also working on an arm to free the 2x ball and get the trip ball. That will also be pvc  :)
Just a question...  How much does that arm weigh and how much is that in comparison to the rest of the robot.  I remember last year, our robot had an arm sort of similar to that, but we had to take it off because it was way too top heavy.  Not trying to get down on you guys though, that is a very impressive piece of engineering.
I really wanted a suck-u-bot.  I think they will make fantastic partners and really control the outcome of the game.  Especially since you can steal from the other side.  Looks great!  Best of luck!
Impressive Funnelbot!  I have to say great jorb.  &lt;=== that was intentional

It would be nice to see a video on how your robot delivers those balls into the Ball Coral.  Again, just amazing!   :D
The reason it has 2, is because it has 2 sensors on it. they are set half a notch apart from one another. The theary behind it is that you get directional ability by seeing the order the things hit. If you dont need direction you could just use one of the signal wires. If you want high res and all the features of the encoder (do you want to know if its going forword or backword) you could just put the second signal wire on its own interupt (excluding the power/ground).
nobody has asked the scary question yet?

are you going to use your superbot for good or evil???

in other words, which side are you going to park that thing under?

your side or your opponents side?  :ahh:
Looks reminisant of our bot 3 years ago, hows the handling, our major problem with a bot shaped like that was the center of gravity was too high.
woh, dont run spikes on the digital in/outs! run them on the relays!
like/love the design and how you got it to work!!!

IMO... i dont like the casters
The secret is that you must have an autonomous that blocks their alliance from knocking off the bonus ball.  From there you must sacrifice yourself to by stopping them from getting in a position to catch the balls.  They have casters, they can be pushes. EDIT:  Oops, wrong bot, w/ or w/o caster you must have a robot that can push them  /EDIT  Do this and you can win.  So to win you need a robot that has a faster/strong enough robot to be there alliance and keep them from the bonus ball.  You need a harasser bot strong enough to push them.  And it would be nice to have the other bot be able to hang.  If the get all the balls most everyone is in trouble.  Otherwise you need a fast robot that will keep them from dumping their load.
Kevin Watson posted an encoder example on his web site kevin.org/frc. The output of the encoder is called Gray Code and is set up so that only one channel changes at a time. Channel A leads channel B by 90 degrees. Thats just a fancy way of saying that channel B won't see a state change until halfway through a state change on channel A. Here is the order the signals will change as the shaft rotates:


A   B
--  --
0   0
1   0
1   1
0   1
0   0


Looking at Channel A, there are two rising edges (transition from 0 to 1). In one direction, from top to bottom, Channel B is 0. In the other direction Channel B is 1. That means that an interrupt triggered on the rising edge of Channel A will give you both distance and direction. You will connect Channel A to an interrupt set up to look for a rising edge and Channel B to a digital input. Inside the ISR, if Channel B is high you're moving in one direction and if its low you're moving in the other.
Thanks guys. I needed that to scout when I go to St. Louis and Chicago. Many thanks guys.
Kevin Watsons example only shows how to set up the interupts. It is alot more involved than that. You must be very acurate with your messurements of wheel diameter or your distance/speed readings will be way off. You also need to know how many times the state will change per turn.


Our compressor pressure switch is wired so that we have the yellow and white wires (signal and middle of PWM cable) on one side, and the black wire on the other side.  We never quite figured out how we were supposed to wire it, but that configuration seemed to be working fine.




That won't work. The RC digital inputs have an internal pullup to 5 volts, so you need to connect switches between the signal and ground pins.
zombie
That was nice. Hands down. I have yet to see what ours looks like because our animator works from his home. He also has to work almost everyday too. So he can't make the meetings.
I wouldent be suprised if the entire problem was due to the huge power drain on your controler. You may have even damaged it. The way you power the pump is via a spike/relay. You wire the pump so its powered by the spike and then you wire a control wire to a relay output.
wow! these guys are nice enough to show a photo and video of their machine weeks before the first regional

and now you are ganging up online to devise strategies against them?

Hows this for a strategy - they have a super way to capture their 18 balls when they drop - I dont see any thing to grab the 2X ball, and I dont see anything to do a chinup with

so if you want to beat them, build a machine that can outscore them - they WILL be master of the small balls on their side of the field, but there are two other ways to increase your own score.

besides, at the end of the match, if they loose, your score will be = their score, so devising a way to prevent them from scoring is a loosing strategy for you in the long run.

BTW - team 93 - nicely done!

No, no.  The compressor is powered properly, from the breaker panel.  The pressure switch, that turns off at 115psi, and turns on at 95psi is wired to the RC.  Then, a signal goes out the relay output to the spike.

In the interest of clarification, here is a simplified picture of our wiring
http://www.imageshack.us/files1/rc.PNG

Not pictured: Breaker Panel, fuses, etc.  Assume that the compressor receives it's power properly.


Edit:

> That won't work. The RC digital inputs have an internal pullup to 5 volts, so you need to connect switches between the signal and ground pins.



I'll pass that on.  So we shouldn't have all three wires connected, only 2?
1. Try to machine a groove in your idler wheels to keep the track in.

2. We made small guides to keep the treads aligned.  They are pretty simple.
We used lexan as a plate, and the cantilevered 2" long bolts (like #10's) from them, with metal sleeves over the bolts to act as "rollers" for alignment.
We have one set placed at the front and back of the drives.

These roller guides are spaced just a little bit wider than our track so there is not much friction. The bolts and sleeves came from Home Depot so they should be easy to find.

If the description doesn't make sense - PM me with an email contact and I will try and send a power point picture.
Here is my take on what I saw on saturday afternoon at the UTC Scrimmage...

1.  Please listen to Tom on the rule about robots breaking the plane of the human player station!  This game is a game where most matches will probably be decided by under 20 points difference...if you lose 10 points due to penalties, it could cost you big time!

2. I think what we saw at the scrimmage was not overly accurate to what we will see once regionals get rolling.  I think once autonomous modes get working and more drivers get practice hanging, focus will turn a little more towards ball manipulation.

3. Based on what I saw, I think this game is essentially 2000 all over again!  With a few twists of course.  That is a good thing....a very good thing.

In closing, I would like to thank Aces High and the other UTC teams who made the scrimmage possible.  As always it was high energy and alot of fun!

Good Luck,
Andy Grady
New from GM & Simbotics, Team 1114. You've seen our gearboxes, now take a look a this.  A prize (awarded at either Pittsburgh, Long Island, Toronto or Atlanta) goes out to the first person who can give me a detailed and somewhat accurate explanation of what this is.

Enjoy.
Im not sure what you might have wrong with your wiring - some things to check:

1. switches only need to be connected between the ground pin and the signal pin - the black and white wires on the pwm cables if thats what you are using which goto the outside pins on the 3 pin digital input connector. If you connect a switch across the red and black wires (+5V and Gnd) that would tend to make the whole digital input section wack out.

2. the IR sensors - are you talking about the banner sensors (yellow and black box with 4 wires)  or the little 3 pin photodetector for tracking the beacon?  The photodetectors dont goto the digital inputs - they must be used with interrupt because they pulse on and off when they see the beacon (low for 1 or 2mS and high for 9 or 8 mS) - they have to be on the interrupts pins so the transisition from H to L can be captured - if you have them on digital inputs and try to read them then sometimes you will see the H and sometimes you will see the L, even when it IS locked on the beacon.

3. carefully check all your wires and make sure a power wire is not loose in a terminal somewhere, and make sure someone didnt knock off a pwm wire to a spike and plug it in backwards.


I have lots of suggestions but no time to post them all now. I'll be back to you after shipping.  We are a team that is 8 years old but went through a major restructuring 2 years ago with new teacher, new sponsors, many new students, if effect, reinventing the team. Some of the first things you need to do is get help for that teacher.  The burnout factor is high for teachers. Make sure the school is behind you.  Approach you administration with what you need. Get other teachers to help, even if they just come in a chaperone the team for a few hours during the build.  We have English and French and math teachers who just come in so our teacher can take a break and then we ask them to write their impressions in a logbook.  They are just amazed at what a bunch of students are willing to do in their "free" time.
Funding is the other big area. Write up a terrific sponsorship letter about who are you. Make sure it's proofread many times.  The best way is if someone knows someone, but if not, target certain companies in your area.  It's better if it is a company that can also provide you with some engineering help.
Later....[/quote]
One more quick thing.  Ask your school for a "Robotics" homeroom next year and have students interested be placed in it.  You need to set this up soon.  That way information can easily be updated every day for at least some of the students.
I'd guess but I believe that I have inside info. Hope it works good for you. Keep us informed on progress. See you in New Hampshire.

Thank you.  That's awesome, we were plugging the compressor switch into all 3 at once (problem #1 ahoy!).  For the IR sensors, I am talking about the black photodetectors.  I wasn't aware that I had to use them with the interrupts, and it's a bit late now to change it.  What I did is I made a little workaroud.  I found that the sensor always knew when it was off, but knew about 50% of the time that it was on.  So, I made some code that would 'remember' that it was recently on for about 7 cycles of the control loop.  This actually works great, as long as the saudering on our photodetectors holds up.  Thank you for all your help.

And I just re-read my original post, and it is perfectly forgiveable to believe that we had wired our compressor to our RC.  Wow, I need a writing class.


Well either this means that you block corrals or you block bonus ball.  Or could it be something else. If it is one of those two I think that we'll be alright.



blocking corrals is cheezy in my eyes but we still may use that only if we had to
ok now which pressure sensor are you using?

FIRST supplied you with two - one that is analog and has three wires coming out of it

and one that is simply a switch - it has two screws to attach terminals - this is the one you want for the digital inputs - if thats the one you are using I cant imagine how you attached three wires to it

no wait, there are some things I dont want to know :c)
Shwaha nothing as interesting at what the other teams do. Mostly making fun of our piece of a robot this year.

We built a full size field in the school gym this year, including buying every last one of the necessary balls. Resulting, of course, in massive dodgeball games.

Two years ago we had an extremely amusing incident where we were testing the functionality of an old robot in our main workroom. One of us (Can't remember who) was driving our first ever robot, trying to get it running for the school assembly. Unbeknownst to him, myself and another member turned on the previous years bot just across the room. Neither was tethered, and both robots were set to the same team number. The result was a large dent that is still in that teachers parts cabinet. Good times.
We thought we forgot our teather, but we just didn't look hard enough untill I was looking for some allen wrenches in the bottom of our tool box, and their it was our teather. so after asking just about all of the team there for a teather we found it, and we blamed our programmer for misplacing it. LOL

DON'T FORGET THE TEATHER!!!!

Please help, i have ffinished the whole animation but one problem...when i export video from premiere 6.5 I can only do .MOV w/ uncompressed or component video....how can i do cinepak or DV/NTSC???????? We bought the latest version of quicktime pro but it does NOT help....is there something i'm doing wrong?????

thanks...
salik



There are 2 ways to do this

In quicktime pro open up the uncompressed movie.
Go to file-&gt;export-&gt;select movie to dv stream-&gt;options-&gt;(choose NTSC)-&gt;and save

or
Go to file-&gt;export-&gt;select movie to quicktime-&gt;options-&gt;select all 3 checkmarks-&gt;seetings(video) click cinpeak, 30fps-&gt;ok-&gt;save
This would be our first experience with treads, as well.  Pretty much the exact smae problem you describe, really.  We ended up trying to live with never turning during most of the season.

If you're really, really hurting for a quick fix that miiiiiight work, I'll tell you what I recall us doing with our treads.  I don't remember the specifics, as I didn't see them constructed, but here goes:

We made our own bootleg self centering belts.  I'm sure this was a very painstaking process.  All I remember is that we eventuallyran on our old belts, except with a ridge on the back.  this might not be an option for you, though.  we were running on the belts inside out, ie. the teeth were running on the ground, and the smooth side was running on our idler pulleys.

I think some of the engineers took a spare belt and cut it into a thin strip.  Then they laid it on inside of our track belt, smooth side to smooth side, and somehow attached the two together.  I'm thinking something like the rivets that hold jeans together, between every tooth, or every other tooth.  Maybe a pop rivet and a small washer on the other side?  Then, of course, we machined matching grooves in the pulleys.

*shakes head*  Now that I think about it, that sounds incredibly crazy and darn near impossible.  Maybe we just did the sane thing and bought some new belts in the off-season.  My memory is a little fuzzy.

PS.  I'm starting to loathe last minute drivetrain testing.  We just recently tested our bot on carpet, and the transmission is eating gears up.  I'm thinking it's not dealing well with shock loads caused by breakers tripping and then cycling on and turning on the motors at full blast.  So we're looking at custom gear sources with very fast turnaround, and some programming changes and driver training to make things nicer on the trannies.


I dunno if this on here and I don't have the time to read 43 pages  :cool: but tons of people I know always get from electrical to stripping :/ its like "I was stripping" and then everyone realizes and stops... so some guys turn it into a pick up line and are all "So you need to practice stripping? Want to in front of me?"   Always fun when they're kidding :)




original, very nice

but...
what about when they're NOT kidding...? :yikes:
For this year, you can be a veteran team and still submit an animation as a "rookie" if, and only if, your team has never submitted an animation before.  As noted above, if your team has submitted an animation in prior years but it was disqualified for any reason, then it still counts as a submission and you can no longer claim to be a rookie.

However, and this is the important part, this definition is good for this year only.  DO NOT assume that the rules will be the same next year.  Personally, I believe that a rookie team is a rookie team, and a veteran team is a veteran team (i.e. words mean what words mean).  If your team has participated in the FIRST competition for more than one year, then the team is a veteran team - including the animation group.  If the team chose not to submit an animation during their rookie year, then it is their choice to pass on this opportunity and they should not be able to submit as "rookies" later.

Otherwise, you could make the same case for every other subgroup on every team.  Your team didn't submit a Chairman's Award nomination for the first seven years?  No problem, just claim to be a rookie "Chairman's Award Group" and send it in and apply for the "Rookie All-Star" award.  Your team never submitted anything for the "Controls Innovation" award, but wrote control system software for the first five years?  No problem, just document your six years of experience, claim to be a rookie "Controls Innovation Group" and apply for the award.  etc. etc. etc.  I think you can see where this would lead.

So I would recommend that if you developed an animation this year, go ahead and submit it.  Even if you think it doesn't stand a chance against some other animations, give it a shot.   You never know what might happen!  And don't automatically assume that the rules will be the same next year.  If you want to withhold your submission and try it again as "rookies", and the rules are different in 2005, don't say you were not warned.

Very nice clean job
New Apple Corps is at it again.  Great job, guys!  This is an awesome design.

Andy B.
when getting dressed for a wedding, i give a rather logical explantion on fasion (how to wear what we were wearing) as we were getting dressed
and my sister turns to the rest of the family and says
"she's an engeneer... she thinks like that a lot..."
and all i can do is have a blank expersion saying
"but it makes sense... what do u mean... huh?"

of course they took my advice :D



when you are disapointed at yourself for not giving "Duct tape" as an ans. for something... :o

eg
my suitemate was getting dressed but the boots were not high enough to fill the slits of the jeans... so i tell her to just staple the slits togather due to the lack of saftypins...

she did it
and it worked
:D
The $64,000 question: Does it have to be dead on to catch all the balls? Or can it be off a foot or more on either side and still catch them all? You never know with autonomous mode.

Also, good bot. Hope to see you at Champs. I think you and Spark 5 would be good partners. :)
I don't think the mobile goals will be doing much of anything. Here are my predictions:

- The little red balls will turn the playing field into a minefield. Those with "add-on" (not integral to chassis) ball herding designs will either fail completely or not herd enough balls to be worth it.

- There will be many matches in which the autonomous balls will not be touched, either through lack of autonomous programs or lack of interest.

- Those who hang well will be few, and those who hang quickly will be fewer. Those 50 points are going to really matter.

- The 12" platform and surrounding 6" level will be a battlefield for those who choose to start hanging from the platforms :)


I had the opportunity to referee at the scrimmage, i just figured i would compile a small list of happenings at the scrimmage...



- A number of teams designed really nice looking operator interfaces, but they did not comply with rule R85 - "The Operator Interface Console designed by your team must fit on the 42” wide by 9” deep shelf"  -- this rule is here for a reason, because of the design of the shelf and the location of the e-stop, make sure you follow these rules, otherwise it WILL NOT fit and you will be holding your controls...




Tom




The FIRST Q&A Forum stated that it is okay for the operator interfaces to hang over the edge of the 9" shelf.  Is this not the case?
Wow, when I saw that big arm on Saturday, I certainly didn't expect that use for it. Great job!

I would have to disagree with you on that, simply because a lot of rookie teams don't have the time **or** resources to be able to do an animation or website, plus the animation is a lot of times a personal thing, only one or two people work on it. So technically if this is their first time doing it, they should have a chance to be a rookie. Being a rookie in the animation is just as hard as being a rookie in the robotics competion; alot of times the rookies of the animation have to figure out the program on thier own, develop their own stories and finally, get everything together for the first time, not knowing any tips or tricks. While teams with more experience in doing the whole animation thing should, in turn be able to turn in higher-quality animation simply because they have more experience.....

Remember to make sure that the baud rate is set properly.  I've got a USB&gt;Serial by GoldX and it seems to be working fine.  It's slower than a normal serial because of the conversion, but it works and that's all that counts.

The first couple tries we had with the converter didnt't work because we forgot to check the baud rate so the controller did that fun program error thing and needed a hard reset.
HAHAHA.

You beat Greg, but I beat you.  I couldn't help it.  It's just such a great picture!!


ok now which pressure sensor are you using?

FIRST supplied you with two - one that is analog and has three wires coming out of it

and one that is simply a switch - it has two screws to attach terminals - this is the one you want for the digital inputs - if thats the one you are using I cant imagine how you attached three wires to it

no wait, there are some things I dont want to know :c)




Wow, your sig was either tailored to respond to my post, or that's kinda creepy.

We were using a switch with 3 terminals.  It didn't look like the in-out part of the switch was deep enough to be analog (it may have been from some of the scrap electronics we have), but I guess that's part of the problem we have.  On one hand, our robot is entirely student fabricated by monetary necessity, and will actually chinup easily and quickly, but electronically, it is quite basic.  See whine below.

&lt;whine subject='programming' tone='unhappy'&gt;
The more I come on to this site, the more I realize that our school does not have a strong electronics team.  I live 2 hours away from the team (I'm the programming mentor, and was the programmer last year), and it doesn't seem that anyone has been doing this type of research when I'm away.  The programmer would program stuff, but nobody tried to hook up the photodetectors, nobody tried to figure out how to wire stuff to the RC, nobody thought about this stuff unless I was around.  Oh well, maybe this year's seemingly inevitable weak autonomous mode, combined with last years non-existing autonomous mode will encourage more attention to be paid to the programming side of things.

I admit that I'm guilty of not knowing a thing about interrupts (and actually avoiding learning about them), but I've only been up to the robot 3 weekends over the build period (I've had swim meets on the other 2 weekends, and we didn't have a meeting on the first weekend, we were waiting for supplies), so I should definetely not be go-to guy on basically anything.  Unfortunately, it appears next year will be even worse, as I won't be around to help (will have a school term for january-april), and there aren't many up-and-coming programmers to replace our graduating one this year.
&lt;/whine&gt;

Edit: Ken, did you guys go to the Canadian Regional last year?  I think we may have been allies on one of our first matches.
When working on the Wildstang bot last year, we tried to stay completely away from tank style turning as we had to overcome so much friction.  While we were on the top of the HDPE we found we were able to perform the tank turning because of the slicker surface.  The only other way we found to turn was with monster truck turning.  This caused us to build a small drop-down skid which propped up one side of our robot and allowed us to do tank style turning on only 2 wheels and the skid.

With all the wheels linked, you will be limited to what you can do.  Hopefully this helps.

how does the cable get over thebar?


The FIRST Q&A Forum stated that it is okay for the operator interfaces to hang over the edge of the 9" shelf.  Is this not the case?




I'm sure your controls are fine if they are deeper than the 9", but be sure to comply with the 42", otherwise it will be very awkward to place your controls on the shelf.

Tom


Our team has a problem ... we have 14.5 inches wheels .. the one from skyway wheels and they are able to go up the 6 inch step ... but now that we bought a carpet and tried out on it .. our victors which power the drill motors (btw we have a tank drive system) shut off if we go at full speed/force, i know a lot of teams are having problems with the wheels themselves they create a lot of friction, even the ones that came in the kit ...

sometimes when we have the compressor on and we go froward the compressor shuts off and the victors shut off momentarily every few seconds while the compressor is shut off ...  we changed the battery too .... is there something in the victor itself that be doing it ... ?!?!?




Do you have the blue backup battery installed?
It would appear that the current draw of the motors is causing the battery voltage to drop far enough to reset the controller. That would cause your compressor to shut down as well.
whats with the pictures smaller than the thumbnails???
when you click on them you should get bigger pictures not smaller ones
yea yea you beat me.....anyone want to know why the robot is called roxanne?...lol  :p
I'll help anthony out a little and try to answer these.

In order:
Thanks.
Thanks.
As far as we allow it to rotate.
Thanks.
Our yellow one popped.
~50lbs.
You are tripping the circuit breakers that power the victors. If this happens when going straight forward, it probably means you have way too little gear reduction going to your wheels. What is your gear ration and are the drills in high or low gear?

If it only happened while turning, you'd probably be ok with reducing the friction of your wheels, but it sounds like you have major problems.
no we dont have the blue battery hooked up ... we're tryin it with it right now .. but the big battery is fully charged and it still does the same thing ...  any suggestions ? :s
The Schmoebots had this problem as well. They solved it by simply removing the tires on one end and running on the rims. There's a little bit of slip from the different diameters, but it doesn't seem to cause any problems.


Somoene actually suggested using a wax type substance like armor-all on the tires?  Would that work, or be legal?





Hmm. Well, I would think wax could be a bad idea, since it could(would?) rub off easily onto the carpet, something which FIRST would not like.

However, what does work, is wrapping some sort of material around the tires...
our gear ratio is 3:1 ... yea we figured its the circuit breaker ... and no its not when the robot is just going forward ... its when its either turning or its going up that 6 inch step ... those are the only times ...
i would love a pair as well

how much do they cost usually?
Ive used both.  I hate both, but I'm going to stick to my PC.  Back in high school the yearbook staff used Macs with adobe pagemaker and photoshop ranging from OS 8 to OS 9.2 and I tell you that OS 9.2 is total garbage.  I've yet to check out OSX, but aparently from what I've read and heard its a major improvement from the previous versions.  The one thing that really urks me about Macs is the file server that they purchased to store the yearbook.  That thing was down more then it worked.  I think they sent it back and had it replaced/repaired at least 3 times over an 18 month period.  If it wasn't for making backups on zip disks, the 02 yearbook would never have been finished.  The other thing that bothers me is pricing.  The cheapest non-student discount computer that I've seen is 799.  The **laptop** I bought in September was 100 dollars cheaper (after rebates and stuff).  It may not be the most powerful machine ever, but it does everything I need it to do.   I'm not convinced that its worth the extra money for what I need, especially on a college student "budget."   Maybe one day when I aquire some money I'll purchase a mac.  For now, i'm sticking with my pc.
if your battery is fully charged you can watch the voltage on the OI - keep pushing the little button next to it till the team number changes to the battery voltage.

Did you use the big 40A breakers or the little 30 or 20 amp ones for the drill motors?

double check your drill motor transmissions - the white gearheads that came with the drill motors have two speeds, you want them in low.  if you have them clicked into high gear this is exactly what will happen with wheels that big - the motors will stall and trip the breakers.

BTW - if the compressor really is going off at the same time as the drill motors then you have your compressor wired to the same circuit breaker as the motor - each victor or spike should have it own breaker - and make sure you didnt accidently wire them in series. OR your battery is  dead and your recharger is not working - it takes about 4 hours to charge a dead battery.
well we cant find out ground stud so we used a simple bolt and use a lock nut and a regular nut to use it instead of the ground stud


how does the cable get over thebar?




The cable isn't actually over the bar.  We attach to the frame in 4 spots for stability.

Also don't listen to Greg about her name.  He promised he wouldn't tell her secret.
Last year, one of our three control schemes was tank steering.  We had all of the wheel modules pointed forwards, just run the left two wheels in unison and the right two wheels in unison.


']This is my first time programming the robot for our team.  I was looking a tthe tracker code and cannot see how it works.

I can see that there are two sensors for each side.  On the left side, you have a left and a right detector and on the right side, you have a left and a right detector.  All I could find in the tracker code was one digital input defined.  How do I connect up the 4 ir sensors and how do I code in the extra inputs to make this work?

I have been basing most everything off the default code... I still am not quite certain how to use the spike relays either...

Nick




The positions are stated in the comments. They arnt defined because they are interrupt driven. Look at the comments in tracker.c and recever.c, I cant remember the exact order but they are on digital inputs 3-6 (interupts 3-6 on your edubot). The PWMs are changeable and that is defined somwhere in there... its defaulted to pwm01 and pwm02, youl have to check the comments for that too. As for wiring... I think a schematic came with the kit... Or at least was in the manual. I cant remember exactly where I found it, but its essentualy the detector wired right to a sensor cable with a noise filter...

As for relays, thats very simple. Relays operate in 3 states. Forword, reverse, and neutral. Each relay relies on 2 binary varriables to deturmine its state. Lets use relay 1 for an example. If you wanted to set relay 1 forward you would do

relay1_fwd=1;
relay1_rev=0;

for reverse you would do

relay1_fwd=0;
relay1_rev=1;

For neutral they would both be zero. DONT set them both to one! Hope this helps


I'm sure your controls are fine if they are deeper than the 9", but be sure to comply with the 42", otherwise it will be very awkward to place your controls on the shelf.

Tom




Also be very weary if you do hang 9" over the shelf depth, that is not necessarily a safe fit for the controls as it leaves them very succeptable (sp.?) to being knocked over in autonomous mode.  Remember, even if you catch the controls, it could cost you precious seconds in any strategy you come up with.  I also recommend that teams use some form of non-slip material on the bottom of control panels.
we bought some 3.5 inch omin wheels this year and ran about $90 for 3 (we are using 4 on our robot) we got ours from omniwheels.com    i am not sure about 12 inch ones but you might want to contact them and see if they have them
yea we used the 40 A breaker for the drill motors and they are in low gear ... the compressor is hooked up to a spike not a victor ...

the thing is the compressor goes on when pressure is low (ofcourse) ... so lets say the compressor is on and we are trying to go up the 6 inch step or turning/spining ... the compressor shuts off at that time and when the drill motors are gettin power the robot controller's LOW BATTERY LED blinks for a split of a second when the drill turn off
You've got me.  All I've got is the limit switch.  Can't figure out the black mysterious thing, it looks evil.  My best guesses were that this was all on a really blown up and the black round globe was a IR detector.  I think thought it an evil wand to make the small red balls all collaborate to lift you and your partner and both other team robots to hang on the bar and then have them split themselves and put 1 more in your goal than your opponents and then cap themselves.  Sounds like a great idea but I think I saw it in fantasia.  And you remember what happen when the apprentice tries to be the wizard.  I hope for your sake you are the wizard, because that many balls could be dangerous. (make sure you ask Q&A before you do this for safety, will someone please post this...J/K, J/K..lol)

Looks good.  Good luck and I can wait to find out what and how this works.  Can't you divulge just a little...

Great job as always Team 93.  If you can reliably catch & deliver all 18 balls to the HP you'll be first on many team's lists, if not a top seed.

Do you sense in autonomous if the hopper is full and drive over to your chute, or do you wait until driver control?  If you can do it in autonomous you'll be even more dangerous.

Good luck this year, and see you at MWR.

how does this work ??

and how do you control spitting the balls out ??
&lt;EDIT&gt;Chris beat me to the punch!&lt;/EDIT&gt;

We (111) faced this problem last year.  The traction on the wheels made it very difficult to turn in place.  While it was possible to do, it caused a great deal of stress to be placed on the drive modules.

We ended up using a pneumatic foot to raise two of the wheels off of the ground to reduce the friction.  The foot had a smooth surface that acted like a skid plate, allowing near zero-point turning.

I've attached a picture of the underside of last year's robot.  The primary foot can be seen at the bottom of the base.  There's a secondary foot on the left for when we went into what we called 90-degree mode.  That mode made the stacker side the front of the robot to make the driver's life easier.  The stacker was removed at the first regional last year, and I don't think the second foot was ever used after that.<br><br>![IMG_0357.JPG|690x500](upload://wkBGv0PWW68OoyQVzBnVz9lpClj.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![IMG_0357.JPG|690x500](upload://wkBGv0PWW68OoyQVzBnVz9lpClj.jpeg.jpeg)<br>
looks like a very complex ball grabber sensor... or an evil device to use to take over the world... either of those.
Do you have the beacon wired properly?  The schematic that came with it is incorrect.  Extremely short distance is one of the effects of the miswiring (others include excessive power draw, and overheating of components in the circuit).  Check the correct schematic located here: http://kevin.org/frc/

You also might want to look at the FAQ at the same location.

Hope this helps...
Nothing official has been released yet, but you can get some more info from this thread: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25026
Omniwheels.com isn't a website, did you mean omniwheel.com?
Those wheels look great but they don't look like they come bigger than 5" diameter which is way too small for us.
we had this exact same problem last year.  the cause was too much top weight and too much traction.  we looked like we were convulsing while turning.  we could never figure out how to stop it and just kind of lived with it.  on the bright side...we never lost a pushing match.  good luck!
Looking at the default code
Navigate.h contains

Left Sensor servo in pwm01
Right Sensor servo in pwm02
Left Drive Motor in pwm03
Right Drive Motor in pwm04

The IR Sensors 1,2,3,4 are configured like this
1 - Left/Left (LL)    - Left Sensor on Left Servo
2 - Left/Right (LR)  - Right Sensor on Left Servo
3 - Right/Left (RL)  -Left Sensor on Right Servo
4 - Right/Right (RR) - Right sensor on Right Servo

They get plugged into
LL - digital 3
LR - digital 4
RL - digital 5
RR - digital 6

The Digital input rc_dig_07 (digital 7) is the switch which states which beacon you are going to chase. Wire a toggle switch on you robot and plug it into Digital 7.
When you set up you robot on the field, you can flip this switch to have the code point to the beacon emmitting the "0" pulse or the beacon emitting the "1" pulse.

Hope this helps.

I don't think the mobile goals will be doing much of anything.




Ill correct that for you:

After they are pressed up against one of the openings on the player station to block them, the mobile goals wont be doing much of anything...
heat sinks and/or fans.  If the problem is really bad, you are geared to high and need a larger reduction.
Muffin Fans mounted over the motors.

Use the 4 inch muffin fan over the pair of Drill motors works great.

Phil
Our team also uses the muffin fans and that seems to help a tremendous amount. I'd like to discuss the idea of a heat sink with any team that uses them.  Team 1163 is using the CIM motors and they are quite large. We're not sure how a heat sink could be built and how it could reduce heat while promoting designability and amterials usage.


How can we prevent motors from overheating?




Make sure that your motors are geared low enough that they don't come close to stalling.
Just a little word of warning for your team.  According to the FIRST definition for hanging, that robot looks as if it is not hanging due to the hook of your robot touching the side bar.  This may or may not be something your team has already discovered, but I just figured I would let ya know, just in case ya missed it because it would be a shame if all that hard work and wonderful design was in jeopardy of getting you points.

From the FIRST Q&A Forum...

ID: 566    Section: 4.3    Status: Answered    Date Answered: 2/15/2004

Q: Is a robot legally hanging if from the floor it extends a rectangular tower (open in center) over the top of the vert bar to contact the horiz bar and pull itself up resting against the outside of the vert more than 12" up?

A: For the your situation, if the vertical post is removed as a SUPPORTING object, it is not apparent that the robot would not be touching the platform. Given that the referees need to make immediate decisions, the situation you present is not easily answered. In theory, the method suggested in your situation (i.e., pulling up on the horizontal bar while being held out by the vertical pole) is legal as a means of hanging. However, the clearance between the robot and the edge of the platform must be substantial enough such that one can instantly see that the robot would still be hanging if the vertical bar was removed. One additional caveat, and which is appropriate for this solution as well, is that the hook / box / lasso that is supporting the robot on the horizontal bar MUST be solely supported by the horizontal bar. If the attachment mechanism is being held in place by the extension of the vertical post (e.g., if the vertical post were not there, the loop of the attachment mechanism would slip off the end of the horizontal bar), then this would not be a legal solution. As it is impractical for the judges to determine whether the friction between the horizontal bar and the attachment mechanism would be sufficient to resist any horizontal element of the force vector, all judgements will be made in the most conservative manner possible. In other words, if the attachment mechanism is being pulled in the direction of the vertical post and it is TOUCHING the vertical post, then the vertical post will be determined to be providing a portion of the support function and the robot will be determined to be NOT hanging under the rules of the game. Bottom line: teams taking this approach are playing a risk. If they are POSITIVE their attachment mechanism will never touch the vertical post and the vertical post will NEVER provide any support function, then they can go ahead. But if they slip and bump up against the post, NO POINTS.

We are in the Chespeake Regional thing, I think.
Predictions after a mini-tournament held in SD last Saturday.

1. Hangers get lots of oohs and aaahs

2. Everyone likes to get complimented for their hanger design but climbing stairs causes bots to fall down and not get up

3. The large 2x ball is hard to maneuver without being dislodged

4. Ball herders will have the floor to themselves while the hangers bang at the summit

5. He who hangs first hangs best. the devil will take the hindmost

6. Mobile goals will be a factor and 1 goal cannot block 2 ports of entry

7.  If a part can break or a bot can go boom its better to do it now than at the big show!
My team won the Woody Flowers Award in 1997.  My name and our team name was announced and my whole team piled on top of me!  I didn't know that we had submitted an entry, so I was totally taken by surprise.  A few students got together and made that happen for our team and for me.  I will never forget them, that year's team, or the first time in my life that my knees actually "knocked" as I walked down the steps of the huge bleachers at Disney up on to the National stage!  Our team is still reaping the honors of the nomination from just a few students initiative!

There are so many special people involved in FIRST.  A big problem, especially with "science type" people, is that they don't brag about themselves.  This is the time!!!  Brag about that special person on your team that makes it happen for you!  Get involved!  It is so much better to do, than to watch!

Not to throw cold water on you great robot design but I showed the picture to a soon-to-be-head-referee and he questioned to contact between the robot and the vertical pole.

He made two points:
1.If I remove the vertical support, will the robot swing down and NOT touch the ground?

2. If the vertical support was not there, could the robot have hanged by itself?

If the answer is YES to both questions, he would probably award the 50 points.

This is NOT an official ruling just a comment on the "little" I know.
Sorry, if this causes any problems.
:(
If you are not driving the omniwheels and want some cheap alternatives here they are:

You could always order some Delrin or Teflon and make skis to support the robot

If you just need a low friction wheel take a sheet of plywood or normal wood and cut a twelve inch circle with a jigsaw. Then take some slick material (thin teflon works nice) and then use wood screws and sink the heads below the surface (no metal cleats) This gives you a nice big wheel with very little weight and friction.

P.S. You mean there are other Olds' out there?




Impressive Funnelbot! I have to say great jorb. &lt;=== that was intentional

It would be nice to see a video on how your robot delivers those balls into the Ball Coral. Again, just amazing!




Pictures and videos will be posted within a week.



nobody has asked the scary question yet?

are you going to use your superbot for good or evil???

in other words, which side are you going to park that thing under?

your side or your opponents side?




We will have to see, however the most logical thing would be to park it under our own.  However we can do both.



wow! these guys are nice enough to show a photo and video of their machine weeks before the first regional

and now you are ganging up online to devise strategies against them?

Hows this for a strategy - they have a super way to capture their 18 balls when they drop - I dont see any thing to grab the 2X ball, and I dont see anything to do a chinup with

so if you want to beat them, build a machine that can outscore them - they WILL be master of the small balls on their side of the field, but there are two other ways to increase your own score.

besides, at the end of the match, if they loose, your score will be = their score, so devising a way to prevent them from scoring is a loosing strategy for you in the long run.

BTW - team 93 - nicely done!




Thanks Ken, your comment kinda reminded me of Andy's soap box [post](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=223202#post223202)  (which btw I had to help the old man get down from).  Also thanks for putting positive imput.



New Apple Corps is at it again. Great job, guys! This is an awesome design.

Andy B.




Thanks Andy, can't wait to see your bot as well!



The $64,000 question: Does it have to be dead on to catch all the balls? Or can it be off a foot or more on either side and still catch them all? You never know with autonomous mode.

Also, good bot. Hope to see you at Champs. I think you and Spark 5 would be good partners.

Great job as always Team 93. If you can reliably catch & deliver all 18 balls to the HP you'll be first on many team's lists, if not a top seed.




We can be off about 6"-9" on either side.  At a foot we miss 1-2 balls which is fine anyways.



Do you sense in autonomous if the hopper is full and drive over to your chute, or do you wait until driver control? If you can do it in autonomous you'll be even more dangerous.

Good luck this year, and see you at MWR.




Thanks a lot Mike, we do not have a sensor, it would be nice however I don't think it’s needed mainly because your adding complexity to the auto mode.Looking forward to seeing you at MWR as well.

We do not have a brake, it was discussed, but we have no where to put it.  We will probably drive around til like the 35 sec mark than move back under.  It is pretty easy to position it under the release.  Also we can be up to 1/1/2 feet from the wall and still catch all 18.


Thank you once again to everybody, I'll be posting many more pics and videos most likely on Thursday or Friday.
1.  A robot that can reliably take the 6" steps against opposition and hang will win regionals/nationals.

2. No robot that "caps" as its primary strategy will make it into the finals in any regional or nationals.

3. No robot with 12.5" wheels will make it into finals in any regional or nationals.

4. 75% of all robots with 12.5" wheels will have a badly degraded drive system by the end of the first regional.

5. Scouting will be more important this year than any other year.  Every strategy (except for the one in #1 above) has a hole in it.  Proper planning (even by a box on wheels) can negate almost any strategy.

6.  Because hanging is so devastating, those teams who can do it will need to find a way to get onto the middle platform in autonomy.  Otherwise, they will have to get onto the platform against active opposition.

7.  Over 50% of all matches will have one or more robots on their sides/backs before the end of the match.
Thanks Cory,

Actually we weighed in last night (around midnight) at 119.0. That's full up, with just a few finishing touches to add. I can hardly believe it myself !! :yikes:
More picture(s) to follow shortly ...

The lasgre gear is in on the output shaft and the smaller gear is on the wheel shaft. All of these came in our kit. We havent riiged any special gearings or customizations.

Thanks




Since there were no drawings of the Kit drivetrain this year, it's easy to have problems with the drive.  I think your problem lies in your gears.  You want to reduce the output speed of your motors using those 90 degree gears.  But you've increased the speed by putting the larger gear on the drive, and the smaller gear on the wheel.  Reverse the two gears (smaller on the drive, bigger on the wheel) and your problems should be solved.  Hope this helps!

Very cool!!! Looks a lot like our design.

Do you have a ball colelctor too?  And how do you release the balls?

Good luck, looks like a winner.
Going out on a limb here...

Prediction:  Things will get broken.




*shakes head*  Now that I think about it, that sounds incredibly crazy and darn near impossible.  Maybe we just did the sane thing and bought some new belts in the off-season.  My memory is a little fuzzy.

.





Would it be legal to buy a new tread and new pulleys and wheels after we ship and then replace our current ones with them at the competition?

If they were exactly the same size and didn't change the design of the robot at all?  :confused:


Question: Does it work on Macs?




Yeah, the keyspan adapter came from a mentor who bought it for his powerbook.  Works great under Linux and OSX.
Motors draw a lot of current because they are put under a high load.  By pushing the motor's beyond 40 amps just by putting more stress on the motors, it would appear that there is too much load in your drive system.  You may have some parts which are not able to move as freely as they would like to.  You also may have problems with parts of your drive train being misaligned.  Any of these issues can cause the motors to draw too much current.

As for my suggestion in solving the problem: put the robot up on blocks and run the drive train.  Stress it.  Watch how the drive train reacts.  See if anything doesn't align.  See if anything hits anything else.  That will help you diagnose the problem.

4. REFEREES WILL HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL!
3. In some games, there will be more penalty flags than balls on the floor.
2. Ball popping maybe common and a crowd pleaser!
1. 13 inch ball travelling at 10m/s becomes lethal to robots

:yikes:
Forgive me for possibly asking a dumb question but aren't you making this way harder than it needs to be?  We've just got an aluminum disk with 30 holes punched in it and the encoder that first gives you.  Our interrupt handler is a whopping shaft_encoder++;
Well, overall, I think that our team did the best that we could. Especially when I'm the only one on the team that does animation. If I had more time or if I had used my time more wisely, I think I could've done better than what we have now. But, I'm happy with the output and glad that all of the hard work is over,...for now.
one thing we have noticed about the drill motors and the supports FIRST supplied for them - the black plastic supports block a lot of air coming from the blower inside the motor.

We experimented with the parts from last year, cutting an angle into the flat sections of plastic, and the increase in airflow from the motors is VERY noticable.

We intend to mod the ones on this years robot if/when we have the motors out of the bot again.
We ran into this problem too.  Much past 20 feet or so the tracker was horribly inaccurate.  It'd find the beacon OK, but it'd be +- 10 degrees, which doesn't help things terribly much.

I completely re-wrote the tracker and receiver code and interrupt routines in order to get a 3 sensor tracker.  I added a third sensor in the middle that simply stares down a bic pen tube and is completely sealed off with electical tape.  Works incredibly well this way, as the tracker needs to be pointing *directly* at the beacon in order to get all three receivers to register.

I can post pictures / code if you want.
Looks hot! These darn WI teams are good, I wish that stupid 269 would post pics of their bot, oh wait :p



P.s. The fast ferry would be a great way for the Canadian teams to get to the Rochester regional next year. ;)



I remember bringing up that very point when we first started talking to FIRST about the regional.

Matt
if the low battery light comes on then you are stalling your motors, you have a weak battery (an old one or one that is not fully charged), or a bad connection somewhere in your power wires.

Im not certain on this, but I believe the blue backup battery only keeps the RC from resetting when the 12V battery drops low - I believe the outputs to the PWMs are still cuttoff at a certain voltage, so yes, if you pull enough power from the 12V battery to drop the voltage below the threshold, then the victors and spikes will be switched off.

Its possible that you have a poor connection in your power wires somewhere. If you have a terminal or wire that is just barely touching, or poorly crimped - it will have a relatively high resistance, and when your motors draw a lot of current, the voltage will be lost across that bad connection

it could be anywhere from the terminals screwed to the battery posts, to the main breaker, your ground stud, the buss box (black square cube thing) your breaker panels - anywhere between your RC and the battery, that causes the RC to 'see' a lower battery voltage under high current conditions.
the PINK team 233 will also be at the omni
I just finished testing exactly this code on the EDU controller. It works fine as long as there are no conflicts with the values that your fast and slow code sections output. I wrote the code for the fast section, and forgot that the slow section would output 127 every 26 msec :) The edu motor sounded really weird as a result. As soon as I figured this out though everything worked.

I am not sure if updating the values that quickly will actually do any good, however. Even if the speed controller can respond this quickly to the change in PWM, the motors and the drivetrain certainly won't. Inertia in the drivetrain will erase all difference between fast and slow updates, I think. If I'm wrong please correct me on this.
I've never used CopyCat, but if it assumes the robot controller of past years, it'll be useless for this years robot since it's a completely different programming language.

It sorta irritates me that the First community continually gives less respect to the software engineering aspect of the project and more respect to the mechanical engineering aspects of the project.  Remember that what seperates a robot from a glorified radio controlled car is the fact that you have to engineer it to be autonomous.

In the past, many teams programmed nothing and simply used the default code.  The addition of autonomous mode was a huge step in the right direction, but I still think the community is doing a lot of hand-holding in this area.  Case in point would be the navigation code that's been written that allows teams to navigate to the IR beacon with no programming.  That's pretty disheartening.

Just my $0.02.
It's fine to call putdata more often than needed, but it would probably be a bad idea to call putdata from an interrupt handler because of timing issues.  The interrupt pin would be disabled for as long as putdata would take to execute.  I'd just set your PWM values and call putdata as you normally do.
If the motors are REALLY overheating, nothing can save them :) Electrical motors don't like spinning slowly. We just melted a drill motor yesterday. Some advice - never allow a motor to sit there with some power applied to it :D This happened to us when the default robot code was uploaded into the RC and an uncalibrated joystick was left connected to the OI for aout 2 minutes. So, either recalibrate speed controllers or create a large "deadzone" in your code.
two things that will decide the game...small balls & being able to hang imho.....2X will have an effect, but not a huge one.....


ah, speaking of hotlanta, any idea what the temperature would be down there during the middle of april? ;)





No hotter than Epcot....i think i might just bring a jacket (traveling north to atlanta will probably be too cold :p )
Yes, this is legal. The rules say that you can bring "identical spares" to the competition.
We have plenty of tem problems with Drill motors....and we simply blow the muffin fan over them and they are totally tamed!

Our CIM motors seem to have a much larger themal mass, and seem to overheat much slower. I suppose if we kept them running for extended periods, they would also turn into red-hot pokers eventually......but our batteries seem to die in about 10 minutes.....

-Quentin :ahh:
Wow.
Baker, Bastoni, Calef ... all in a single thread.
In itself, this should be impetus for teams to stand up, notice, and submit.

How cool would it be to overwhelm judges with all of these wonderful, personalized stories about FIRST's most influential people?

900+ registered teams, and I know every team has AT LEAST one of these stories to tell.  Even if your team hasn't considered it until this late date, a 600 word essay can easily be completed in three days.  Let's celebrate leadership and commitment of the best kind.
You know you're addicted to FIRST when...

...there's a certain type of Body Shop soap that reminds you of robotics... :]
(weird eh?)
246 also generates a large number of wacky quotes. For example, today's meeting yielded "I wonder how many gerbils it would take to make a bandsaw run at the right speed".
I look forward to see your team as a winning entry on the Autodesk DVD next year!
I suppose thats worded wrong, then.  I'll look into it, but I'm guessing that you can search either the body or the title, and not both.

If this is the case, it may not be easily fixed.  As nice as the feature would be, I don't have the time or patience right now to search through (and potentially break) 2500+ lines of code.


Yes, this is legal. The rules say that you can bring "identical spares" to the competition.


HOLD ON A MINUTE GREG :ahh:  ... this is one of those situations that you shouldn't be too quick to answer.  I happen to disagree ...  I suppose if they were ordered before ship date then the "timing" would be OK ... but if the parts they are referring to are truly "identical" then it seems it would not solve their problem.  This is really a question for FIRST.
30? We got a laser cut piece of polystierene with 16 holes and it works fine. I guess what direction the bot is going by assuming that power over 127 is forward and below 127 is reverse. Good for speed, bad for distance :D
We had a similar problem with our drill drive motors last year.  The root cause turned out to be current draw.  We discovered this when we borrowed a portable ammeter from our electrical lab at work.  The solution was to simply lower our gear ratio.  The down side was that we could no longer use the drills in high gear for a high speed.
This is very typical of some designs.  You do not say what your configuraion is so I am going to assume four wheel tank or two wheel with non steering two front wheel.  These types of drive systems use incredible amounts of current when turning.  Again, if there is any friction in your drive train it will manifest itself as high current in the drill motors.  Can you describe the drive train or include a picture?
Stu,
Looks awesome!
Can't wait to see it in action.

A great entry from 1018.

My team, 177, has perrenially had this issue we finally broke down and made omniwheels for the rear.  Our experience shows that having lower friction in the rear wheels increases manueverabilty while retaining control compared to the fronts.  Most teams who saw our bot at the UTC scrimmage can attest to it's speed and manueverabilty with these wheels.  We were also never at a loss for traction.


If this is the case, it may not be easily fixed.  As nice as the feature would be, I don't have the time or patience right now to search through (and potentially break) 2500+ lines of code.




I definetly don't want you to potentially break the code at this point in the season. I was think more that if it wasn't an easy fix, you could report it to the vbulletin developers.


Somoene actually suggested using a wax type substance like armor-all on the tires?  Would that work, or be legal?




No you can not do this, once again a case of "if you don't know don't answer"

**&lt;R15&gt; Lubricants may be used only to reduce friction within the robot. Lubricants shall not be allowed to contaminate the playing field surfaces, balls, or other robots.**

You can use anything that will stay on your wheels, tape, paint, glue. But nothing that will rub off and contaminate the field.
Whoa!  Awesome.

YES YES YES!!!!

what Ben said!

you assembled the transmission backwards - the small gear MUST be on the motor shaft and the large gear on the wheel shaft

man! your wheels must be spinning a couple thousand RPMs when you have them off the floor!

also, it would be better to get the original drill motors and white gearheads in there instead - they are geard down lower than the Chips - and the FIRST transmission was designed for them.

If your motors were destroyed you can buy replacements, you can even buy complete Bosch drills at the hardware store and put them in tonight - it will cost you more, but dropdead date is only 3 days away.
no climbing the big steps for us...we tried to concentrate on ball control, and were very successful.


if the low battery light comes on then you are stalling your motors, you have a weak battery (an old one or one that is not fully charged), or a bad connection somewhere in your power wires.

Im not certain on this, but I believe the blue backup battery only keeps the RC from resetting when the 12V battery drops low - I believe the outputs to the PWMs are still cuttoff at a certain voltage, so yes, if you pull enough power from the 12V battery to drop the voltage below the threshold, then the victors and spikes will be switched off.






Actually, the PWM outputs keep driving even with the main battery disconnected.  I've notice this because after I turn of the breaker, my IR sensors keep scanning.
My daughter lives in pittsburgh, going to college there.

We could all have a party at her apartment!   (maybe not all 3000 of us  :ahh: )

there is a hardrock cafe across the river from downtown - we go there every time we are in pittsburgh - excellent place for dinner.


The Schmoebots had this problem as well. They solved it by simply removing the tires on one end and running on the rims. There's a little bit of slip from the different diameters, but it doesn't seem to cause any problems.





or make a wheel outa lexan or delrin ;)
I'd tend to agree (doesn't hurt that I'm a programmer ;)) - as it is, FIRST is more "For Inspiration of Radio-Controlled Cars and Technology". Yes, remotely controlled devices can be referred to as "robotic", but I think it would be nicer if more emphasis were put on autonomous operation.
ok then maybe the Victors have a minumum voltage, below which they dont function

still comes down to the same cause: either

motors not geared down enough and breakers are opening

bad connection somewhere causing a voltage drop at high current

weak (faulty?) battery?

or the laws of physics are no longer in effect :^)
oh...OOHHHH i get it....wait what?!? from what I can see your robot has the ability to talk and introduce itself as "John"


Forgive me for possibly asking a dumb question but aren't you making this way harder than it needs to be?  We've just got an aluminum disk with 30 holes punched in it and the encoder that first gives you.  Our interrupt handler is a whopping shaft_encoder++;




The wheels on our robot are 12" in diameter. It would be difficult to mount an encoder disk anywhere but on the output shaft, so 30 holes would give us a resolution of 1.25". Not too bad. The down side is that if we get pushed backwards we won't know it. It also takes time to punch 30 holes in a disk, mount the sensors and debug it. We bought a 128 count/rev optical encoder. It gives us a resolution of 3 tenths of an inch, plus direction for free. Its one extra line of code to check the other encoder channel to get the direction. For a tank-drive robot the math is fairly involved to convert the distance measurements to the actual position. We figured that if we're going to do it we should have the best resolution possible.
MAK rocks!

cant wait to see what that all tranlated into in alum and steel

will see you at Pittsburgh

and Cleveland!   :^)
Yes it is legal, as long as one robot does not block both the opponents ball corals at the same time.

The robot is great, but the fact that is only contolled by a human is what makes it special. I've always been interested in robotics and have read a lot about then and built two small ones. (Not that they were very good :)) When I first heard about FIRST, I thought, "That's not real robotics, they are remote controlled." I found out later that there is autonomous time, but the point is still the same. At least in my mind, a robot is a robot because it can function on its own.

Like DeltaCoder said, it helps that I'm a programmer. :)

Helping a team out who isn't so good at programming is ok, but giving them the code doesn't help them learn how to do it next time.
are you guys running 2 cim's? and if you are are you running both motors through one fuse?, because that will definately cause them to blow under any load, the only other thing you could do is to de-sensitize the joystick signal with programming, but don't ask me how to do this, i don't do the programming for our bot.


Whoa! Awesome.

Thanks for the compliment Joe.  Unfortunately we are not able to do either.  Our strategy brainstorming sessions "told" us that those should not be our first priorities.  Additionally we are only a second year team, and we are trying to stay focused on robust designs that are not too complicated.  I can say that we have made incredible strides from last year, both in our design/build process AND our robot's capabilities.
hope That Everybody Does Good!!  :)
Ohh... That's an intresting concept, being able to uncap while hanging...
Good job guys!

hence the reason why I refuse to straight out write code for another team, beyond modular things like a lookup table example. I'll debug code, and rewrite a few lines so it works better, and I'll give examples with pseudocode, but I don't write an entire program for someone.
It was a great success for our team.
We worked out a few kinks in our drive that are now keeping us up and running well. We also found out many details about how the game may turn out being played, and we found out that we can only do certain things in a certain position...  ;)
All in all, it was definitially worth the 2.5 hour drive. We had a great time.

Hey all.  Hope all is going well and your successes are many this week.  I've got a question about wieghing the bot.  We measured earlier and were close, and are weighing all parts as they go on, but we'd still like to weigh the whole thing at once.  Who does this?  What's your techinique and/or piece of technology that you use?
i am taking a shot in the dark here but was team 768 there and if they were how did they do?
you might want to read through your rulebook a bit more thouroughly though because it is in there and you might have missed other key information ;)

My interpretation (someone go ahead and shoot me down) has always been that you can bring any kind of raw material to the competition that you want, if you intend to build something there.  You cannot do ANY kind of alteration to this material during the time between the build period and the event.

"raw material" in this case is anything that you would normally buy rather than make.  Bolts, nuts, gears, treads, etc.

I mean, you are allowed to improve your robot on site...including adding brand new mechanisms...seems to me you'd need to bring something to make that stuff from.

If I'm way off, please let me know.  We are neither rule-stretchers nor rule breakers, and would regret it if we have been misinterpreting this rule.

what? how do i know?well, okay, first my sister joined in, on the team (#47). She told me every thing that they have done. So, just by telling me that, i got so into it. Soon, i got into a after school program called "girls in tech." i didn't relize that it was part of what my sister was into. i went to their OCCRA games. so, i loved it so much and can't wait to go into high school and joined in also. :D hey, you got to love it!! :D

I can personally testify to the size on the operator controls our is one of the teams that must redesign our spiffy control board.

*Also, robots that can control the goal will be very usful as in one of the championship competitions The red alliance shoved there goal into the blue alliances best HP ball coral and the robot was unable to remove it
*Around the bar is going to be the blood zone were robots will be shoving each other out of the way (i.e. RAGE in the Finals)
*Matches will be very close and one shoddy shot or penalty (which there will be many) will have a HUGE effect in the outcomes.
*HP are gods in this game

Best of luck to every in hopes that my formentioned thought will help and thank you to Aces High for another excellent scrimmage

P.S. Just want to thank Geal Force, Team 126, for allowing our HP extra practice during one of their practice rounds. This will not be forgotten and we all wish the best of luck to you guys.
Thank you....it turns out i had 6.1 which couldn't export....
I'm still struggling with how to figure direction.... Any help?
I want to see a match where they catch the balls from both sides.  If they get under theirs...and it drops during auto mode...and the other side doesn't drop until the 45 sec. mark.  I'll be watching for it.  Can you get the first 18 out fast enough to be under the other ball drop at 45 sec?

Again...great job.
We used treads in 2001 and hated them.. but Robbie Extreme (56) used treads also and had a lot of luck with them.  They said that the trick is to put pop-rivets all along the tread down the center.  Then on all of your wheels, cut a groove that the pop rivets will slide in.  This is basically how tanks do it.
FIRSt actually touches on this subject in the rulebook. It is completely legal to get off the shelf parts bought after the ship dae, however you cannot modify the parts in any way between ship date and the competition. Now, if you want, you can assemble any changes you want to make to the drive train at the competition with the raw materials/ off the shelf parts you purchased between ship date and the competition ;)
i want to know what 1 second equals to in this part
1000?
400?

what is it!?!?!?


I'm still struggling with how to figure direction.... Any help?




I'm assuming you have an ISR coded already. Connect the signal pin not connected to the interrupt and ground to the signal and ground pins on digital input number 8. Your ISR will look like this:


volatile signed int distance = 0;

void Int_1_Handler()
{
//check the other encoder channel. you may have
//to switch the comparison value to 1 depending on
//the configuration.
if (rc_dig_in08 == 0)
{
distance++;
}
else
{
distance--;
}
}

The official weigh in is during the practice day of the competition, by the volunteer robot inspecters.

We do our preliminary weigh-ins with a calibrated scale that was surplused from our corporate sponser.

The scale is an extremely accurate one formerly used in our space division.
I think that the jobs of the judges will be a difficult one this year, given the leeway left for interpretation in the rules. I doubt that a judge would call goal tending on an opposing team if their opponents' human players shoot balls at the robots...there will be much interpretation of the rules made by the judges at the competition this year and rulings will probabably differ from each event.
I like the omni wheels and ball claw. What's on the ball claw to allow it to grad better?
a good way to weigh your robot if you don't have access to a shipping scale is to take a bathroom scale and put 2 pieces of 2x4 on it then sit your robot on the 2x4 look at the weight and then subtract the amount of the 2x4.


also please let us know how the transmission problem went and if you need any immediate advise feel free to call me 410-963-6085


Ive used both.  I hate both, but I'm going to stick to my PC.  Back in high school the yearbook staff used Macs with adobe pagemaker and photoshop ranging from OS 8 to OS 9.2 and I tell you that OS 9.2 is total garbage.  I've yet to check out OSX, but aparently from what I've read and heard its a major improvement from the previous versions.  The one thing that really urks me about Macs is the file server that they purchased to store the yearbook.  That thing was down more then it worked.  I think they sent it back and had it replaced/repaired at least 3 times over an 18 month period.  If it wasn't for making backups on zip disks, the 02 yearbook would never have been finished.  The other thing that bothers me is pricing.  The cheapest non-student discount computer that I've seen is 799.  The **laptop** I bought in September was 100 dollars cheaper (after rebates and stuff).  It may not be the most powerful machine ever, but it does everything I need it to do.   I'm not convinced that its worth the extra money for what I need, especially on a college student "budget."   Maybe one day when I aquire some money I'll purchase a mac.  For now, i'm sticking with my pc.




Your sig, on the other hand, indicates some connection to having used Mac OS X, does it not? That is the "Aqua" window bar present in OS X.... ;)
When I was on 992, we threw the robot in the back of a minivan and drove to the nearest FedEx office.  They were more than happy to let us use their scale.
if you are referring to the black area, it is not gripping material, it is actually airplane flooring.  This is very light weight material, and also provides awesome rigidity.  This material is sandwiched by the aluminum plating.
Whats VCC?

is that a thing that would be used in the actual competitions?

Has someone fried their system yet using that port? :)
If the gearbox is assembled correctly, as was suggested in previous posts, then start of by removing the motors and turning the wheels by hand to see if there is any binding through the gearbox. Tweak the gearbox until all binding goes away. If those are 12 inch wheels, they ought to be spinning only 2 or 3 revs per second. 3 revs per second is about 9 feet per second, just to give you a ballpark estimate of speed. If those wheels are turning faster than that, your gear ratio is too high.

Good luck. We've all been there at one time or another. Just don't panic and start blaming anyone. Just concentrate on diagnosing the problem one piece at a time.

Rob, the second drawing shows the IR to be 3' 8" or 44" .
Awsome robot design....we had something like this on the drawing board, but we changed horses and went to another concept.

I still like that idea, and think you will do quite well with it.

The code to navigate to the IR beacon is sub-optimal. As they said at the Kickoff, there is a lot of room for improvement. The reason the code is included is to give people who have never thought about how to control a robot autonomously a place to start.

Also, if you want a mechanical analogue to the software "hand-holding", look no further than the working drive train included in this year's kit. It will help rookies and teams short on resources to compete without making them powerhouses or overly limiting those teams that attempt something more complex.

The relaxed additional electronics rules and the new brain have gone a long way to making electronics and software equal partners to mechanics in the building-a-FIRST-robot equation.
hmm, the two drawings do appear to be conflicting with each other. I would trust the one I posted more since thats the updated ones they posted and its labeled the 2004 field elements.
It's kind of too late for this season, but for future reference http://www.aircable.net/ sells cables that can communicate at up to 30 ft wirelessly. One side has to be plugged into a wall, but the other can be attached just like a normal serial cable with no extra battery drain. They don't require any special configuration of the software either. :ahh: I don't actually have them, so I can't verify that they are a legitimate company, but just in case anyone wants to give it a try. :)


I want to see a match where they catch the balls from both sides.  If they get under theirs...and it drops during auto mode...and the other side doesn't drop until the 45 sec. mark.  I'll be watching for it.  Can you get the first 18 out fast enough to be under the other ball drop at 45 sec?

Again...great job.




We wouldn't need to get all 18 out, I am guessing that our collector can hold 30 balls with our arms open.

That would be the optimal match though for us.

Looks pretty cool.  I don't like the price much and I'm pretty confident that you could find cheaper than that, though don't quote me on that.

I don't know.. I thought it seemed easier to read in the second one.  Your pdf made it hard to know if that was the to the pvc or to the IR.  Anyway they would take it down if it was wrong.  I think the 37" is to the pvc and not to the top of the IR.
I'm rather confused... ha ha ha, programming newbie...

Our Spike connected to the compressor is hooked up to realay port 8, and the code under ifi_aliases.h consists of:

#define relay8_fwd      LATDbits.LATD7
#define relay8_rev      LATJbits.LATJ0

All the other ports say LATEbits instead of J, and Would have progressed consecutively, so, I think the bottom line should say LATEbits.LATE8, but I'm not sure.

Our spike is now running on red, and it is shaking and as hot as the above have described. Should I change this bottom line to what I thought, or what should I change it to?

Thanks,
Charley.


When I try to build, I get this error message:

Though it was still tested before each match....

I may have won, but you got the picture.  I couldn't seem to find one I liked.
We did pretty well, but we REALLY underestimated rendering and all.  Even with simple geometry and low polygon counts (we're newbs) and few reflective surfaces we still churned out some huge render times.  Anyways, we didn't submit for the award but be on the lookout for next year, it's gonna be a killer!
Another thing that I forgot to mention was that our team always plays Twister at our hotel every night. Maybe teams at Chicago and Atlanta could also play too.


i want to know what 1 second equals to in this part
1000?
400?

what is it!?!?!?




The processor runs at 10 MHz, 10,000,000 clock cycles per second.  The joystick info (etc) is only updated every 10 MHz / (2^18).  That's 10,000,000 divided by 2 raised to the 18th power. 2^18 is 262144.  So 10,000,000 divided by 262144 is 38.1469... cycles per second.  One cycle has a duration of 1 / 38.14... = 0.0262144 second, or 26.2 milliseconds (ms).

So in one second, there are 38 or 39 cycles of the "main loop".

You can pre-calculate certain fixed periods of time (using pocket calculator or the Windows calculator accessory, not the robot controller), converting from seconds to cycles of 38 Hz:

To know when a certain pre-determined amount of time has passed, say, 11.7 seconds, figure out how many counts that would be:

11.7 / .0262144 = 446.3195801

and round to the nearest integer, because the controller works fastest with integers:  446.

A quicker way?  Mutliply seconds by 38:

11.7 * 38 = 444.60000

which is 445 when rounded.  A little different than 446.  An even faster way that you could do in your head:

11.7 * 38 is about: 12 * 40 = 480

Close enough?  Think like an engineer and make that decision yourself!

Remember, to count these cycles, declare a "static" variable.  "static" means that the variable isn't lost every 26.2 ms cycle, which could happen otherwise.


static unsigned int cycleCounter = 0;


You might have some code that looks like this:


if ( cycleCounter < 446 )
{
// this part gets used for the first 11.7 seconds
}
else
{
// this part gets used after the first 11.7 seconds has passed.
}

cycleCounter++;  // increase the cycle counter by 1.

Don't worry about this so much now.  You will have practice matches at regionals to find out how judges on this rule.  If a team is removing the 2x from your goal during a practice match, have your human player throw a ball at the 2x ball (!!!!NOT THE ROBOT!!!).  It the ref throws a goaltending flag, throw another.  If he dismisses it because of intent you've got your answer.
i have a few questions ...

what if some of your team members are in grade 13?  do they count as seniors even if they are in their fifth year of high school?

what if one of the team members graduated from high school on january 30th.  does she go in as grade 12 or university student .. because she isnt in university and shes not in school either ... but is still considered part of the team ...

does White refer to all students with white skin? or Canadian/American background ?? (would a Russian count as a White student .. or Other Ethnicity?)

Does Asian refer to Indians as well? or would Indians go under Other Ethnicity ??

thanks for the help ..

A Question:

Is the "DV - NTSC" the same as the "DV/DVCPRO - NTSC" codec?

Note:

We are rendering our animation form max in the "Animation" codec. We will export as an AVI (Indeo 5.10) from our editing software, and we will convert it to MOV in max (Prob. Cinepak (Our DV tests have been worse then Cinepak)).

Call the paremedics and take my friend AND the dream girl.  My freind drives and dream girl sits on my lap! You said she was willing to do whatever I want...
if i'm understanding you correctly, all you would need to do is duplicate the output of the left-side motor for the second motor on that side, and the same for the right-side second motor - where the code sets the right-side motor to a certain value, just set both motors on the right side to that value (and by motor, I mean PWM)
Troubleshooting this problem will be much easier if you can get you hands on a clamp- on ammeter. Check with your sponsors and mentors or find a local electrician that could help in finding one.

Put the robot on the bench with the wheel suspended.  Use the ammeter to monitor the current of each drive motor.  The meter should be placed between the circuit breaker and the speed controller.

Compare both sides running at the same speeds.  The current should be close for both sides.  There is a slight difference between forward and reverse for the drill motors.

If the current is high (&gt; 10-15 amps) then you may have too much friction in the drive system.  If the current is low on both sides, place the robot on the ground and monitor the current for each side while the robot is running straight.  IF the robot is drawing much higher current when on the ground vs. the bench, look for things that might add friction when weight is added to the wheels (i.e. wheel axles).

One of these two steeps will tell you where the potential problem is located.

Tim Tedrow
have you tried the code on www.kevin.org/frc yet?
What are you using for the non drive wheels?
That might work, but the back motors are different from the front motors, the front motors are CIM motors and the back motors are drill motors, does that make a difference?


Goaltending does not result in a penalty. The team whose goal is being goaltended would receive double the points of the ball that was blocked. The goaltending team's score is not affected.




Not saying that my team woudl do this as it is not GP but does that me that if we are holding the large ball over our own goal and our alliance partner goes to shoot at the goal and the ball is deflected on its downward path that our alliance would get double the point of that ball which was deflected? Or vice versa if the opposing allaince did this thing would they then get double the points?   :ahh:


I was just wondering... What kind of paint did you use? and how did you do it?




It's powder coated (Like a dust you melt on). I don't know much more than that about the colours.
I need to check our supply but we will be able to help.  We will most likely not be in need of batteries at the same time as you so we may be able to supply you for your matches, both teams.  This may not equal 4 batteries but swapping charged for uncharged after matches may help.  At least until finals.

I will get back to you tomorrow.
are you using a gearbox so that the motors end up matching spin speeds? if so, it should work fine. if not, you might need to make a function to translate the value going to one set of motors into an appropriate value for the others... i.e. if your chips are on pwms 1 and 2, and the drills on 3 and 4:



pwm01 = leftvalue;
pwm02 = rightvalue;
pwm03 = drillTranslate(leftvalue);
pwm04 = drillTranslate(rightvalue);



the drillTranslate() function might just be a simple curve, or you might need to use a lookup table.
Yes it does matter, especially if you are using the drill motors.  If because of gearing or programming you are back driving the drill motors you may do damage to the transmission.  You will need to adjust the speed so they run close to the same.

happy birthday john! i'll give you a 6-pack of pepsi at nationals if you come up to our pit and ask for a belated bday present.


v. nice. now is it standards compliant? ;) (heh, i had to find *something* complain about :) )

it really is a great site, though.




Well we do usually try to stay within standards. I can't say that I am 100% but my team has been warned about it.

I have tested it on different browsers and different os. My dynamic DHTML menu was the thing that gave us most problems. It was a bit complicated to align the menu properly at first (on Opera and Safari for Mac I noticed things would change dramatically so I fixed that up asap).
I have run Anim8or v0.85 in WINE on Knoppix. (I did get some errors but it did run!)(Now I just have to figure out a way to save settings and I won't have to use Windows for AN8 (That Dosn't count the whole NTFS problem.))

I have tried to run max in WINE, but I can't setup the DLLs right.
I won't go so far as to say what our problem was, but I'll warn other teams to CHECK THE BATTERY POWER before you take out the gearbox!

(We'll check around for an ampmeter, but a fresh battery seems to have fixed the problem for now!)

Thanks for all of your help.


What is the highest Videolengeth:Rendertime:Videosize that a team has had this year?

Ours is about 8Sec:70Hr(Approx.):720x480.  :ahh:

(I hope you can understand what I am saying. (I havent had a decent sleep since kickoff.))




I'd guess ours is 3sec - 10hr - 720x480 - about 10min/frame, which isn't too bad. You probably shouldn't be getting anything above 20min/frame since this is usually a sign of a poor scene management rather than computational complexity.

Here are 3 steps to bring your render times down:
1) split the scenes in parts. As a general rule, each camera shot gets its own max file.
2) Reduce poly count. delete everything not in sight, subsitute everything in the distance with primitive geometry, and apply multires to everything else.
3) Tune down your GI/raytracer settings. Its pretty hard to tell the difference in quality, but the rendertimes will be cut in half
Since the collaboration thread was closed Tuesday night, how then did a member of team 254 post the last word?  Stud Man Dan was the last person on before it was "closed".  I tried to post shortly after the Stud Man and it had been closed by then.  I got a daily notification just this morning that there had been another post to the thread.  It seems it is closed to some then but not to all?
just looking at your pictures i think i can tell why you are having your problems.  with the direct output of your gearbox going all the way to the wheel your axle is acting like a huge lever and missaligning your gear box.  while it may seem like your wheels might have a flex of only a milimeter it will affect your gearbox. what i might sugest is to separate that axle and conect it with a flex coupler to account for any mis-alignment that may occur. if you have a second set of the black plastic couplers that first gives you, you could cut your shaft attach the hex gear to either side and use the black coupler as your flex coupler...hope this helps feel free to PM me if you have any questions



btw have you made sure that the clutch is in the drill setting aswell...try this first

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archangelrobotics.com%2Fmain.php

first of all, SCRIPT tags should go inside the HEAD tags.

second, the HEAD tag isn't closed - there's no /HEAD tag.

finally, somewhere you've got a CENTER tag that isn't closed - check the link above for more detailed info on that

if you really wanted to be standards-compliant, you could add ALT attributes for all of your images, but you don't *have* to.

So, to answer a couple of questions from the previous thread ...

We have two of these on our robot (rear wheels). They work MUCH better than expected (especially after the mod to replace the K'nex with Lexan). "Luci" is a four wheel drive machine with 9" pneumatic Skyways on the front. And obviously, from our low frame design, we won't be climbing the platform ... but we do have other surprises in store ... ;)

The large outer white rings are polypropylene. "Spokes" are carbon fiber disks, and we are using aluminum for the hub. MUCH THANKS goes out to our newest sponsor - WaterJet Cutting of Indiana - who made these wheels possible. All parts were cut using waterjet, then finished as required with milling, turning, and tapping. Our team had a great field trip to WCI to see some of these parts being cut and learn about the process. :cool:
Stu...I believe you are supposed to me working!

hehe...so am I!


Not saying that my team woudl do this as it is not GP but does that me that if we are holding the large ball over our own goal and our alliance partner goes to shoot at the goal and the ball is deflected on its downward path that our alliance would get double the point of that ball which was deflected? Or vice versa if the opposing allaince did this thing would they then get double the points?   :ahh:




First, you can't goaltend your own goal, so you wouldn't get double the points in the first scenario.

Second, if you are goaltending your opponent's goal, they would get double the points if the referee determines that you are intentionally goaltending (and he sees it). If you are blocking your own goal and they shoot at it, no one would get any points (you can't goaltend your own goal).
That post was in another thread, that got dismantled/removed.  I put the post on the end of that thread, to combine all discussion into one place.

As you may know by now, the Florida Regional does not have a social scheduled for it this year.

Well, we at team 1083 thought to do something about that.  We're looking into an "unofficial" social.  I stopped by a local bowling alley called Boardwalk Bowl today.  They claim to be the biggest bowling alley east of the Mississippi and south of New Jersey, and I can see why.  They have a HUGE facility.  From what I gather, they have 48 lanes available for us to reserve at 9pm on Thursday if we want them.  Of course, we could ge there sooner and hang out, but the lanes themselves wouldn't be ready 'til 9.  One game with 5 people per lane should take about 45 min.  After hanging out for a while, people should be able to get back to their hotels in plenty of time for their curfews.

Some key notes, it would cost each person $4.50 for one game and shoes.  This place has a Pizza Hut, concession stands, and a deli with Boar's Head meat.  They have a very large arcade with 3 air hockey tables.  They have 17 pool tables.  They even have a sports bar in there for the 21+ crowd.  And I heard that their wings are amazing.

To qualify for that group rate, we would need at least 15 people who want to bowl. (Heck, SPAM would more than account for that alone ;-)

What I need from you is some official word from your team whether you would be interested and how many would want to BOWL.  People who don't want to bowl can still come and hang out, but we need an accurate count of bowlers to reserve the right number of lanes.

RSVP by emailing to [email]pelln@ocps.k12.fl.us[/email] and we'll get back to you with directions and such.

So?  Does this idea sound like a winner?
Sweet


Nice. I really like your claw.

Out of curiosity, is there a reason why the small balls look like they're riding on your robot? Thanks :)




Thanks. The balls were put there because we were discussing protection for the inside of the bot (we're worried about something flying in there and causing some damage) so .. some protection is being designed now.  :)

As for the ball dropping, yes, it is easy to drop it, but if you get a tight grip and have good drivers, it should be fine. Its just one of those things that require some learning.
Hey Stu, knowing you this is your goal grab system that requires four of these used together with a 4 lb cylinder. :D  :D

Ok,
I can't run over there this afternoon, but you have a lot of teams close by that could give you some help if they were to see this in action.  You have removed the locking pawl from the drill transmission, haven't you?
My advice again is remove the drill motor and transmission and the driving shaft.  The remaining shaft with wheel on should turn freely.  If that is OK then, put the robot on the floor and try to push it. It should just keep going by itself, in a straight line.  If it doesn't keep going but goes straight then the bearing on the wheel shafts are not in alignment.  If it rolls, but not straight then you do not have the wheels parallel.
If all of that works OK then put the driving shaft back in and check everything again.  Remember that the driving shaft and driven shaft must be perpindicular else there is side friction on the gear faces.  Check that the gears are in correct mesh alignment.  This is a hard one.  Visualize a line perpindicular to each shaft (as if drawn on the face of the gear.)  Those lines should meet perfectly. If the tangent of the driven gear is not aligned with the center line of the driving gear, additional friction is built up.  If all of that is OK, you should be able to set the wheel in motion by turning the hex coupler on the driving shaft and the wheel should continue to turn by itself for a few seconds.  It make take a little trial and error to get everything to the point where it can make this test.  When it is all moving freely, put it back on the floor and test again.  There should be a significant improvement.  Once that is OK, put the drill and transmission back in and try powering the motors again off the floor.  Again the drive should free wheel after you remove the driving power if you have the speed controller set to "coast".  If all of this is OK then put the robot back on the floor and try to drive.  If everything was OK up until now and the breakers still trip, you may have to add a bearing to the wheel shaft.  The weight of the robot may be putting too great a load on the bearing you are using.  Let me know what you find.  I will check in again in an hour.

You could always make an autonoumous dongle.  Then you could go into autonomous at the flip of a switch instead of setting the team # to zero all the time.  [Directions from Innovation First on how to build one are here](http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/Competition_Port_Pinout_Guide.PDF)   Also the disable switch is a very useful safetey feature
We find that using a drill to cut weight is not easy--it takes houndreds of holes in sheet to make a difference-unless it's small to begin with, you use a holesaw, or it's thick stuff (but then the whole thing is too heavy anyway). We used a saber saw to cut large triangles out of the drive plates- saving about a pound per plate. Our wings are similarly cut.  We are now in the 120-125 range, so we are glad we did.

Many of you may have seen "wrench man", 449's logo. We have "person" made out of ~1" head wrenches, that weighs about 5 lbs. We hope to be able to add him to our robot (but only if we dont add any other weight for systems).

Hi all, here are today's 3 Questions...

1. What are 3 awards that were in exsistance in 1998 that are no longer around?

2. What orange flavored soft drink is made by the same company who manufactured FIRST water?

3. What and when was the first scholarship award created in FIRST?




1.) Featherweight in the finals, Best offensive, Best Defensive

2.) Fanta (Orange)

3.) 1996
OUCH !  :eek:   I should have known to exclude 234 from this quiz ... :D
We are still under the weight limit currently but we are resorting to "speed holing" our robot rather than swiss cheesing it in order to add another mechanism.  No important structural components will be drilled only pieces that are easily replaceable and do not harm the structural integrity of the robot or the drive train.  I like speed holes........doesnt slow the robot down so much..lol
1. Most Photogenic (Replaced by the imagery award), Best Play of the Competition, Featherweigh in the Finals, Outstanding Defense, Best Offensive Round

2. Faygo and Shasta are both made by the National Beverage Corp. and both have orange flavored drinks.

If the problems start up again and you can't get through them, PM me with your contact info, I may be able to either talk you through the process or stop by (though our machine is not running yet, so you know where my mind will likely be).

Too bad the k'nex didnt work out from the first set........It made my day to see K'nex used on a first robot.......lol.  Keep up the good work, those wheels are awesome :)


Some may say it makes the feel like a criminal when they havn't stolen anything.  Address to the students that "stolen items must be replaced with team funds.  Therefore, it costs you more when someone steals from the team."  I think that will make students prefer innocent searches over having to pay more or fundraise more to replace stolen goods.




I do not think that saying the replacements will come out of team funds will work because if a person is stealing from the team in the first place, i dont think they really care what effect there is on the team.  that being said, i do not have a better solution.

I like talking to the parents directly, but that is a problem when it is one of the teachers/mentors.

sorry that this is happening to your team and i hope that it all works out in the future

See you in the hotel!
Coolness :) that's a load off my mind
Just hook the black (gnd) wire to one screw and the white (signal) wire to the other.  You should crimp ring connectors on the end of the wires for a good connection.  The red (+5v) wire is unused.

In the future you should post a Technical question like this in one of the Technical Disscusion forums (Electrical or pnuematics).

[EDIT] If you are using the default program you need to connect the 3 pin connector to digital in #18 on the Robot Controller [/EDIT]
That's not really true, it more or less depends on the textures in your scene. If you have many materials with reflection and/or a lot of procedural materials (Like the ones I made) your rendertime will be high because of the reflections and having to shift through 18 different levels of bump maps.

Five seconds, 27 hours, about 9-11 minutes a frame was our highest.

I had three computers running on marathon last week to get a 14 second segment done.


Hi all, here are today's 3 Questions...

1. What are 3 awards that were in exsistance in 1998 that are no longer around?

2. What orange flavored soft drink is made by the same company who manufactured FIRST water?

3. What and when was the first scholarship award created in FIRST?




1. First seed, featherweight in the finals, best defensive round

2. orange slice

3. WPI in 99
are you sure you are not in autonomous mode? (check the disable light on the operator interface, if it is blinking yellow, the robot is in autonomous mode).  it may be that you are in autonomous mode, but the robot does nothing. i had a similar problem ...... http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24386

Amusing calculation from last year:

(1/4in)/2 = 1/8in
pi(1/8in)^2 = 0.049087385212341in^2

Yes, reading from right to left does make things interesting. I did pick up a manga book once and I had previously thought myself good a reading comic books even though I don't read them much. But when I found out that they did it japanese style (right to left) I was often confused. :yikes: Oh well.




Originally I was too. I read a DBZ manga a few years ago from left to right and when I got about a fourth of the way through I noticed I was going backwards.

But why stop a good thing.  :D

Why is it unfortunate to drill holes to cut weight?  We *plan* for lightening holes.  There's no shame in it.  The weight drop is significant, when you are toying with 130 lbs.

Might look like that, but I highly doubt they had that in mind.  Many bots will have similar design, but will most likely not be identical.
Team 007 will look forward to meeting you on Thursday in the pits.  Maybe we can have our own team social at the hotel!We'll have around 25 students and 4 adults.

i agree with the ability to knock out the 2x balls... BUT!!! while doing so you could easily be nailed with a small ball by an acurate HumanPlayer can hit your arm while trying to grab the 2x... so unless you have a way to come UNDERNEATH the 2x ball, it might be a little bit tricky to do... we shall see =D
Those look very similar to the 2003 Cornell Robocup omni-wheels. Get any ideas from them? :)
Assumptions:
Battery is fully charged
(high current testing requires constant attention to charging)
(battery depletes fast with two 40A breakers cycling;
good 40A breakers open @ ~50A ea x 2 = 100A,
and open at lower currents as cycled more frequently)

BTW: **18AH SLA battery is discharged in 3 minutes at 54A to 8V !!!**
see the mfr discharge curves to verify, docs: 18ahExide.pdf

so at 100A continuous expect only a couple minutes at full energy.....

DO measure the current where the breakers open, (on full batt charge)
last year we found many 40A rated opened at 30A (~26A rating)

How ??
**Use a DVM, 200mV scale connected across the 120A main breaker**.

when ckt bkr closed the current is ~1A for each mV on the DMM !!!

A 3 digit DMM will thus read +- 199.9A

(The open ckt bkr reads ~12.6v, which will not harm a DMM)

First impression from photo's:

with 12" wheels you are geared too high

(are other wheels unrestricted castors ?
if so it should do circles rather well,
but may be hard to drive straight line)

use smaller wheels  3" would move well :)
or Gear Down 3:1, 4:1
I know neither is attractive at this point, sorry....

if dig in 1 is on then it should turn left
if dig in 2 is on both motors should dturn equally
if dig in 3 is on then it should turn right

PWM01= left side drive
PWM02= right side drive





i think what you are trying to do is



if (rc_dig_in01 == 1) ||  (rc_dig_in02 == 1) {
pwm01= 200;
}
else {
pwm01= 127;
}
if (rc_dig_in02 == 1) ||  (rc_dig_in03 == 1) {
pwm02= 200;
}
else {
pwm02= 127;
}

Yes, but only where no one could see them. like in the sprockets. only because our robot is going to be the best looking robot in the competition this year.
on a more personal note, i like to see holes in robots because they make them look more of an "unprofessionally" designed robot and you know that they did experience the weight issue that most every team deals with. :)
no we will be at suffolk which is a little closer to where we live?
Team 219 is bringing like 4 batteries, so if you guys come over to us, ill bet we could spare at least one (just bring your own charger!)
Our head programmer suggested:


if (rc_dig_in02) {
pwm01 = 200;
pwm02 = 200;
} else if (rc_dig_in01) {
pwm02 = 200;
pwm01 = 127;
} else if (rc_dig_in03) {
pwm02 = 127;
pwm01 = 200;
}else {
/* No line found.... */
}

Thank you both for your fast reply I will test both of those now and let you know when I get my results. THANK YOU SOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!! and best of luck to both of your teams.

Heres the code i ended up using:



if (rc_dig_in02) {
pwm01 = 200;
pwm02 = 200;
} else if (rc_dig_in01) {
pwm02 = 200;
pwm01 = 127;
} else if (rc_dig_in03) {
pwm02 = 127;
pwm01 = 200;
} else {
pwm01= 127;
pwm02= 127;
}



and it works perfectly thank you for your help

The other two buttons:
p1_sw_aux1
p1_sw_aux2

The joystick itself:
p1_y
p1_x

For the hat on top do a search. It is harder to use and has been discussed a bunch.


im bit confused about 26.2 ms loop area part

does that mean 1 = 26.2 ms when i set up a counter or something?  :confused:




It means that the code within that area is executed approx. every 26.2ms, so if you increment a variable it should indicate time in approx. 26.2ms steps.
These are all defined in IFI_aliases.h
take a quick look there.




We all know C, but we do have a question.  We were mapping various functions to joystick buttons and we don't know what all of the joystick button variables are.  We know "p1_sw_trig" and "p1_sw_top", but we don't know any other ones.  I know this sounds sort of dumb, but if anyone could just post the variables here it would be appreciated.  If they are declared anywhere in the program, if anyone could tell us where that is, it would be helpful.

For last year's joysticks:

The other two button variables, aux1 and aux2, are not wired to the joystick.  They will do nothing unless you build a custom circuit box.  In the OI docs on the IFI website, they have fairly complete pinout diagrams which may help.
I think most teams with engineer-support drill speed holes, too.
I'm not a big fan of the informative flyers that many teams passed out last year. Good scouting entails not only collecting basic information, but a good look at the robot, inside and out, the drivetrain, the structural integrity, and several other factors that a mere card simply cannot encompass. It gets pretty annoying to get harrassed with advertisements come alliance-picking time, too.
Yeah, I've done stills that have taken 8-11 hours to render before. It's not that big of a deal really.

Really? Unless they did something I don't konw about (and they could have), the electrical portion of our controls team hasn't done anything to them. Oh, well, as long as it's working... :]


Two of our so called "Robot Widows" ended up getting so fed up with the engineers not being home, that they decided to be part of the team too.



One of our engineers has been working with the team so much his wife did that too.


I stopped by a local bowling alley called Boardwalk Bowl today. They claim to be the biggest bowling alley east of the Mississippi and south of New Jersey, and I can see why. They have a HUGE facility.




Dude, I have been to this bowling alley and it is far the best one I have ever been to!  If I recall, they had an extensive arcade area, with an alternative DDR arcade machine (either StepMania or BeatMania).  I know during summer nights, the bowling alley reserve several lanes for some Cosmic Bowling.  To get you an idea of how big this place is, they took an old Wal-Mart and converted it to this massive bowling alley (I think they have a total of 90 lanes).  I would highly recommend reserving those 48 lanes.  Now if we can get several teams to be willing to go.   :D
The Aux1 and Aux2 are on the Top of the joystick and on either side of the "hat" button.
They do work as I've coded them for some functions on the robot.
The "Top" is actually in the thumb area.
The "Hat" switch is like a joystick within a joystick, but will only give  you a few values to work with 0,45,127,254 (I think)
Trig is the Trigger obviously.

The IFI alias header file contains them all.

DON"T USE THE DRILL GEAR BOXES!!! Biff can write miles on that.

It's easier to find the RPMs and build it that way. So in code, you just set each to the same. We're using CIM and drill motors this way, and it works fine.
For two years our team has had problems with the helical gears...but we didn't know it. We always had a problem turning with 4 wheels due to the lateral friction involved in tank steering. This year, we though we solved that problem by increasing the wheelbase and moving the front and back wheels closer together. But, the clutch still slipped. In direct drive, the 40A breakers popped, just like you are saying.

If the clutch slips, it probably isn't a problem with the actual motor (which must be providing enough torque to make the clutch slip). It is much more likely that there is just too much resistance somewhere...especially if turning is even harder than driving straight.

So after two years of bad luck with 4WD and the drill motors, we tried something today that we never did before: lubricating the helical gears. The difference was AMAZING. How stupid could we have been! Anyway, if you haven't already tried this, it might help.

As the rules state -

"Acceptable Codecs: DV-NTSC and Cinepak. Do not use DiVX or any other non-standrd Codec"

So, I'd say only DV-NTSC and Cinepak.


Hey,
I have been getting the following compile error ever since I added a certan function with a switch/case statement.
/cygdrive/c/mcc18/bin/mcc18.exe -p=18F8520 "user_routines.c" -fo="user_routines.o" /i"C:\\mcc18\\h" -D_FRC_BOARD -Ou- -Ot- -Ob- -Op- -Or- -Od- -Opa-
c:\robotics\FrcCode\user_routines.c:325:Error: syntax error
(note: This is the methoud I have used to compile code, and it has worked before)
Here is the code that is causing the error:


void Drive_the_Arm(void){
switch (light_status){
case NONE_IN_RANGE: Search_for_Light(LARGE_MOVE);	       break;


light_status is an unsigned charicter that has been defined as 0, NONE_IN_RANGE has been defined as 0 and LARGE_MOVE has been defined as 240.  Search_for_Light is a function that accepts unsigned chars.
Does anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this error?
Thanks!




First of all, no tabs and use the CODE tag.
Second, try:

void Drive_the_Arm(void)
{
switch (light_status)
{
case NONE_IN_RANGE:
Search_for_Light(LARGE_MOVE);
break;
}
}


I believe that the colon also denotes lablels, And I think that you can't have commands on the same line (I certainly wouldn't!). Try that.

Also, is Large move a const or alias?
Thanks to all who have helped out here, I think we have pretty much solved our "problem."  Is anyone actually planning on using the "hat" switches?
The hat has been discussed, and has issues. There are constants posted to use it. Search for Hat Joystick in this forum.
one thing that can make a bot go totally berzerk is if you output 255 on a pwm - 255 is the start of serial data flag, so you must limit your pwm variables so they can never be 255

what happens is the  output string restarts when it sees the 255, so the variables you intended to be digital outputs will end up on pwm outputs, and the pwm variables will not be going to the right pwm pins

in other words, the bot goes completely berzerk!


Smaller, lighter and .......

More to come later.




Any idea of how well this thing will hold up in "clutch" situations?  :D

-Slim...
I certainally hope that DV/DVCPRO - NTSC codec is the one that they were referring to when they asked for DVNTSC, because otherwise we've rendered to the wrong format =). On file sizes, I'm getting around a 130MB file with DV/DVCPRO and sound, and it seems to look fine (although interestingly enough it looks fine when it comes out of MAX, but horrible coming out or priemier. Not sure who to blame there...). I still wish that they let us choose codec this year (last year we used a lossless codec and it looked very nice).
I have a two-way suggestion that might help determine a suspect.

1.  They don't care about the team as shown by their theft of things.  This means they are more likely to skip meetings to do other things.

2.  They do care about the team, and that makes them open to guilt trips about what they did.


Our team has a shop area that is locked and only a few adults have a key to it, so things can't disappear between meetings.  Within that shop we have a school closet/wardrobe thing that is locked.  In there we keep the software, team credit card, and student info stuff.  To my knowledge, we havn't had a problem with people stealing stuff, but only with overzelous shop cleanings by new shop managers who didn't know that those funny connectors he threw out were $300 worth of parts.

Things also often get tossed somewhere in the shop by someone who dosn't know where they are suppost to go, and they get found a week later.  If you havn't, I would suggest asking

Our team works within one room, with the shop area in the back corner of it.  The openness makes it hard for someone to just walk off with significat parts.  Our animation team brings their personal computers in from home, so no incentive there.


An open work area, everyone working together and friendly communication are our best defense against theft, as well as one of our greater assests as a team.

did you follow the instructions on the innovationfirst site for installing the MPLAB SW?

you cant use the install that came with the disk - there is a very explicit set of instructions you have to follow, this might be why its acting the same everywhere you install it?
This card is not a scouting mechanism. It is meant not to replace scouting but simply to provide nifty handouts and pictures of robots for teams to share.

5 codec questions:
1. In what player will the judges be viewing the movie file?
(when played in windows media player, small blotches appear
over the screen)
2. Is there any way to fix these blotches?
3. If the quicktime file (.mov) is able to play in windows
media player, but has a small message saying "unknown
player source" will it be considered a nonstandard codec,
even though it was compressed in DV-NTSC?
4. I notice in programs like 3dmax and other editing programs, their are certain titles such as 'pixel aspect ratio' and 'video compressor' (with configure labeled next to it). Under pixel aspect ratio 'dv-ntsc' is also listed, is that required for the dv-ntsc codec or should it remain on square pixels? also if you choose certain compressors I notice it does not let you configure that setting as the compressor(will it render as that codec wihtout hitting configure next to it if it saves its location as the slot marked?) or do you need to meet certain requirements for the configure setting to highlight?
5. Is there any audio compressor requirement?
sorry for the confusion - I did not mean piston = pneumatic cylinder - I was thinking of a spring loaded piston as a spring device, not something that uses air pressure to move.
The shirt for this should definatly have a robot with a cloud of gas coming out the back, with the name inside it...
That is correct.
there is default code already in the controller, but its not the latests version

Im pretty sure the one joystick drive that outputs on pwms 13-16 is not in all the RC units -

so yes, there is something in there

but if you are planning to drive with one joystick you might have to get the most recent default code from innovationfirst website and download it.

cutting off at 9V? do you mean its only putting out 9V at full throttle, instead of 12?

you might need to calibrate the victors

are you sure you code is putting out 254 and 0 for full FWD and REV?

are you sure your battery is not going dead?

one other thought - if you are seeing 9V on the output of the victor make sure there really is 12V onthe input side with the motor running - maybe you have a poor connection somewhere in your power path - those big wire blocks need to be tightened up good to get a solid connection.
Why do you need to pause the program?
For testing purposes?

If so, you can code a switch, when closed allows the code to execute, when released if stops.



if ((autonomous_mode = 0) || (AUTON_SWITCH = 1))
{
execute auton code
}


Or something like that. (I don't have my code in front of me. :)
AUTO_SWITCH - is an alias to one of the O/I joystick triggers for testing only.  Make sure to remove it before comp.

some teams use those pool noodle raft things and they seem to work...
Just to clear some things up..

720x480 29.97FPS is NOT Standard TV size, It is standard DVD NTSC Standard.

352x240 29.97FPS is Standard NTSC TV size.

Now by reading the rules, it says the acceptable format is Quicktime, or .mov.

This being said, you can easily render in 3d studio max with an uncompressed avi to achieve maximum quality, and then encode to .MOV using a Quicktime Encoder found on the net. This will allow you to achieve the greatest quality possible and actually control the file size of the output file.
And all you need to do is tie-wrap them on :)

We are just trying to test 1 cim with the joystick using PWM 1? Should we have a problem doing that? We have tested a servo and that works fine, but when we hook up the speed controller (and its working fine) and the cim we dont get any output from the cim with the joystick. Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Hmm.. Does the LED on the victor change colors as you move the joystick?


I've looked all over the rules, the Q&A system and this forum, but I haven't been able to find anything about controlling 2 cylinders with one solenoid valve.  Does anyone know if this is legal or not?




I couldn't see why it wouldn't be. We've got this setup you're talking about for our herding arms, using two Y connectors.

As long as the regualted pressure isn't above 60psi, I'd say it's well within the rules.


This is a good reason to get rid of the "ship after 6 weeks" rule.  Teams that build two robots (to work while their robot has been shipped) are already working through the entire competition.  The six week deadline isn't saving these teams any work or any stress.  In fact, if we didn't have to ship the robots, these teams would be doing less work (since building a second copy of the robot is obviously more work than only building one copy and keeping it).

It seems to me that the only teams that build two robots are the teams that have the money and/or manpower to do it.  If FIRST is interested in a level playing field (for the small teams), then perhaps it's time to do away with shipping the robot off in 6 weeks.  That way, everyone has a robot to work with between competitions.

I also think that this takes away some of the advantage to going to many regionals.  At the regionals, the teams get to work on their robots, work on programming, make modifications, fix problems, etc.  The more regionals you go to, the more opportunity you have to fix things.  If teams keep their robot, every team has equal opportunity to fix the robots, make modifications, etc.

Some may argue that this takes away from the "real engineering experience" of having a deadline.  I disagree.  You would still have a very real deadline: your first competition.  If you don't like having to work on the robot at the end of six weeks, then don't - no one would be forcing you to.




To me, that is a very profound thought.  The 6 week rule is something that has been so consant in my 5 years in FIRST, that I'd never enven considered getting rid of it.  I will have to give it some thought, but I think I may end up liking it.

As for 'robotics widows', one of our electrical engineers made a deal with (got an ultimadum?) with his other.  Try comming to meetings for a year, and if you like it, then stay, if not, she gets a cat to keep her company.  As it turns out a few years later, his current job is keeping him later, so she is at more meetings then he is.  For the currious, 'she' is MissInformation.

it should work - does the LED on the victor stay steady yellow with the joystick centered, and go green on full fwd and red on full rev?

do you have the victor powered through a 30 or 40 Amp breaker?

are you sure you got the victor hooked up with power on the right side? ( the same side as the pwm cable is on?)

if the LED on the victor blinks yellow it means its pwm cable is not plugged in straight, or pushed down all the way, or the cable is backwards at one end or the other
John's rampant awesomeness warrants a splash page.

Happy birthday to an awesome guy.
We used this last year. As long as the regulator is set at 60 psi, it is legal.

Just a word of cuation if it werd: if you are using the setup, make sure that the tubes are the SAME LENGTH, so the same ammount of airflow goes into each cylinder at the same time and rate.
you can hook up as many cylinders as you want to a solonoid


Uhh, Dave, the menu doesn't work at all when reloaded in a new page in Mozilla/Netscape. Just to let you know. You have the award for the CR.




it works fine for me in Mozilla, Firefox, Camino, and Safari....


cutting off at 9V? do you mean its only putting out 9V at full throttle, instead of 12?

you might need to calibrate the victors

are you sure you code is putting out 254 and 0 for full FWD and REV?

are you sure your battery is not going dead?

one other thought - if you are seeing 9V on the output of the victor make sure there really is 12V onthe input side with the motor running - maybe you have a poor connection somewhere in your power path - those big wire blocks need to be tightened up good to get a solid connection.



We checked the input voltage and it is 12VDC.  We do not reach full throttle before it cuts out at 9 Volts.  It is only the Chip and Victor on one side (we are running a dual motor, drill and chip, transmission on each side) causing the problem.  Our battery is fully charged and has been changed and the problem is still there.  I have checked with the programmer and even had him do a full forward in program mode.  The Chip still cut off at 9 Volts.  He has also reassured me that the code is set for 254 and 0 for full FWD and REV. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Aaron
We don't build our bumpers outside of the 36 by 30 zone, so they aren't 'technically' bumpers, but our robot is surrounded in 1/8" diamond plate.  It does the job well.

i know all the LEDs are blinking green
*it should work - does the LED on the victor stay steady yellow with the joystick centered, and go green on full fwd and red on full rev?*

**It stays yellow throughout and does not change colors **


We have evcerything else correct, we are hooked up through 30a breakers, the victors are hooked up right, but the light stays orange throughout.

What does this problem point to? Is it a calibration prob? Could someone walk us through the calibration process?

Thanks in advance,

team 1380
This is the first year 93 will be using muffin fans, to keep the electronics cool (as they are pretty compact this year! ;)) As long as you can get a decent airflow inside your robot by the motors, I wouldn't worry too much about putting in the fans. Unless you really need them, they're just extra weight and another thing to worry about wiring up!


Alright, my team is totally new to this (we don't have any of the animation team members from last year returning) and we have no mentors who have any experience with MAX, so it's pretty much just tutorials for us.  Anyways, I was wondering if anyone could direct me as to how I could make dust... I've made plenty of particle systems, smoke looking things, etc, but nothing with the soft edge of dust and I can't seem to find anything on google.  I know your time is important but go figure, all you great animators out there probably have to start rendering today :)




What kind of dust are you refering to? Like small dust particles flowing in the air, or just dust on top of some objects? For second case, a texture would do, but im guessing you are talking about particles flowing in the air.

For a good start - look at max6 tutorial about making boat splashes with Particle Flow system. They describe how to make water mist, which is very similar to dust.

About soft edges - have spherical particles with falloff map asigned to opacity channel of particle material- this should work.

Good luck.
wasnt diamond plate illegal on robots? (this is the same stuff they use on the driver stand right??) if not disregard and pretend i never said this :D
Ok we have a scene with GI, ALL of objects carrying raytrace map, around 300k polycount, and complex particle system with post effects. All of this takes 10 min/frame. You just have to play with the settings - it really pays off.

>  If you have many materials with reflection and/or a lot of procedural materials (Like the ones I made) your rendertime will be high because of the reflections and having to shift through 18 different levels of bump maps.

Umm...  thats lack of optimization. The procedurals can be easily rendered to bitmaps, and so can be the 12 layers of bump maps.
Happy Birthday John.

I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing that I recognize half the people in that picture.

If it runs as good as it looks, you guys will do great
they did.. yet they changed and who knows .. mayb improved a few things

Instead of the smaller drills from 3 years ago they used the globes.. and at the top they used the windows

very impressive guys :-)

I'm sure your going to have a very industrial grade and very competitive robot this year

Might look like that, but I highly doubt they had that in mind.  Many bots will have similar design, but will most likely not be identical.



actually they said the design was inspired by 312 in earlier posts....either way it looks like one heck of a good job....gl with it....

First of all, it seems that carbon fiber and such are allowed this year.




As part of the 'such', is titanium allowed?

No.  We used it last year.
Could someone walk us through the calibration process?
You could run the muffin fans over the motors between matches, or use canned air, or something to that effect, to cool down the motors, if you don't want to worry about wiring the muffin fans up or adding weight.  You could even build a heatsinc.
So just use the same values for both and it should work fine?
Yeah... Richard is still there.  It's sad the way Jenna left though (even though I avoid spoilers like the plague and still knew that was going to happen).

Either way, 3 of my longshots are now gone.
Oh yeh. I will get one of my guys on it asap. It should be done by Friday night. I completely forgot about ALT's and stuff -_-. So much to do so *little* time.

About the DHTML menu, yeh I have to fix that its *very* annoying. I use Mozilla as my regular browser and it really bothers me. I have to find the time to work out the bug.

Well I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch but I wont deny that I want the award :-) We are trying our *best* and hopefully it will work out for us in the end.

In an assembly you can creat a sketch on a side and project a view onto this side from another part.  This sketch stays only in the assembly file and does not edit the part.  Is there a way to tell Inventor to create this sketch/extrusion on the part file itself?

Thanks,
Cyber Blue 234




Yes.  Just make sure that you've right-clicked on the part name in the tree listing and chosen to edit the part.  You'll know that you've done this successfully because the remaining parts in your assembly will become semi-transparent.  You can still project geometry onto your sketches, though.
If you're just running the drill motors, their not gonna get hot because their is no load or strain on them. In competition, a lot of strain is put on the motors, and they get extremely hot. Using muffin fans is a very good way to keep them cool throughout the match.

As for using canned air to cool the motors, this is not recommended by a number of people, including engineers on this very forum. The reason is because it can damage the brush housings inside the motor. My team did this last year before each match, and while it worked well for a few matches, we started seeing problems down the line, such as the motors cutting in and out. It's just not recommended to use.

Actually, the grip is quite strong when the drivers have the claw control on maximum power. I don't think we'll have too many problems with ball dropping.  :]
Do you guys really need all that traction?

Also, how do you plan to score points? All I see is the arm. (in the picture, anyway.)

Hmmmm.....Looks strangely familiar to me! :D
hehe, we'll hang and do a little more.  You'll see.  But we can lift an extra 200 lbs if we need to get someone off our backs.  what it comes down to is our autonomous. we're integrating line following, dead reckoning and IR sensors to achieve a reliable autonomous.

if you connect a servo to the same pwm output, and the servo moves when you move the joystick, but the victor stays on solid yellow when you connect and move the joystick, then I suspect your victor is not working correctly.

The calibration process: get the official Victor Calibration Instrument (also know as a straightened paper clip :c) and push the little tiny button on the base of the victor and hold it - the LED will start to blink.

Move the joystick all the way forward, then all the way rev, then back to center - holding the tiny button the whole time, then release the button

the light should go back to steady yellow in a few seconds.

I dont think this will fix your problem, but you can try it - I recommend you try another victor - connect it up carefully, and see if it works.
Im not sure what you mean by it cuts off at 9V?!

do you mean as you speed up, once you get to 9V on the output the victor goes dead? the motor stops? the circuit breaker breaks the circuit?

or do you mean the output only goes up to 9V and no higher?

if the breaker is tripping then I would think your motor is binding - something in that part of the drivetrain is too tight and the motor is drawing enough current to trip the breaker.

are you powering both the drill and the chip when this happens?

are you using the drill motor gearhead that came with it? are you sure its in low gear and not in high?
a better way to set up a timer, if you are comfortable with it, is to use the processor interrupts. [www.kevin.org/frc](http://www.kevin.org/frc) has some sample code that can be cut and pasted into your code. I knew nothing about interrupts and timers and such and after a few hours staring blindly at the screen everything clicked. its really sweet how everything works. search chiefdelphi for other threads related to interrupt driven timers
449 should be there-if the robot is working. We have driven, and done a chin up already, so it is likely.

Even if the robot doesnt make it some people will be there for fun.

The motor cuts off at 9 Volts (the speed controller goes dead and stops giving power until the voltage is dropped back down).  The motor is not tripping and the gearboxes are not binding.  We are using the drill motor that came with it and it is in low gear not high.  I have doubled checked all of this along with an engineer and two other mentors.  Any other ideas?
I wonder if the drill motor is spinning the Chip faster than it wants to , turning it into a generator, and putting 14 or 16V or more onto the motor side of the Chips Victor? maybe that is causeing the Victor to wack out?

Do I understand this correctly - you have a voltmeter on the output side of the Chips Victor, and as you ramp the speed of the transmission up, once it gets to 9V the victor goes dead? what does the meter say then?

is the drill motor still spinning the Chip when this happens?
entertainmentS
if you disconnect the Chip from the victor and put something else on it, like a loose drill motor or a globe motor - does it work correctly then?
disturbing @ best...... :eek:
Team 612 from Chantilly Academy will be there.
you can get the connectors and pins from Digikey and make your own cables - but I dont think they can overnight them to you this late in the day

OK.

It runs on batteries, no gas.
It's a earth-friendly green machine. LOL :-)
Nice job on the bot.
It's rather sad and all. I had the (in retrospect foolish) view that people who do FIRST are above that sort of thing. As far as I know, it's never happened on our team (except one or two persons stealing other persons caffine sources). However, sign in-out and bag checks, while extreme, will get the idea across. Plus general annoyance = peer pressure. This is a good thing.

Tangentially, I may be revealing my ignorance for your scorn, but there's a competition for the best CAD model?
if you download the default RC programmers guide from innovationfirst.com in the documents section it will tell you which joysticks and wheels are mapped to which PWM outputs - and some of them have limit switches associated with them

when all else fails, put the default code back in and use there input to pwm mapping whenever possible

BTW - would you mind taking a second and going back to your other thread and briefly post what you did to fix it? when someone searches the forum, and sees your problem, it would be nice to know what the solution turned out to be :c)


You wouldn't be the only one liable because they're legally responsible for anything that happens on their property.

i betcha the catalac engeneers had fun with that one. maybe you should let the kids do some work, eh?



Our team has two electrical/controls/programming mentors.  I was the one that helped with the controls board.  I told the students not to make it too heavy and not to make it too complex.  As you can see, they listened to my recommendations. ;)
Other than that, I didn't touch it.  Please remember that what you say is not only a reflection of yourself, but also your team.

Can we make a law against stupid lawsuits like that so people can just live normal lives without having to worry about getting sued for ridiculous things?
you'd be surprized how many teams start designing their robot 10 minutes after the kickoff video ends

and weeks later (maybe) they figure out the best possible scoring scenearo.

Our machine eats balls off the floor, then regurgatates them at the HPs feet

its biomimricry - we fashioned our robot after a robin  :c)
the timing of the loop, or how hard you tell your bot to turn when you detect you are loosing the line, depends on how fast your bot can turn, how fast its running, and whether or not you just hit one of the spots where the line changes direction.

line tracking with two sensors is simple  -you space them out so the are on opposite sides of the line, and you put your robot pointing in the direction you want it to go

start the robot moving straight

if the right side sensor sees the line then you have turned to the left, so you tell it to turn right until it no longer sees it

and same (opposite) for the other side

but thats where you have to try some values, see how your bot responds, and adjust the amount of turn, the speed of the robot...

there is also the possibility that the sensor will see the line, but not be able to turn fast enough, and cross over it completely (if its going too fast)

all these things need to be tested with your machine and you need to tweak your settings - also, if you put more than two sensors on the bot, you can cover the possible variations with different responses.
not the one that came in the KOP - its RS422

but I believe you can get an RS-232 radio link and use it instead of the program cable - very useful for seeing printF statements while your bot is driving around on the floor

(or you can hook several download cables together instead :c)
...No, those are speed holes!
Sorry, to John if it seems that I am stepping on his toes and sorry if John's post sounded a little unclear but we already have a successful line tracker that we just finished earlier today (our code is posted in "Line seeking help" )  I believe, if I remember correctly, that John is searching for the dead reakoning code where the robot operates practically blind and just follows code saying go this way for so long than this way for so much long.
The Chip cut off with me holding it in my hand, not in the transmission.  We swapped the Chip and drill motor Victors, and the problem followed the Chip to the new Victor.  We're now seeing the problem happen on both Chips.

The latest vague theory is that noise from the motors is messing with the PWM signal.

(This is mentor Charlie, signed on as Aaron.)
The US is the only country in the world where you can sue someone for nothing - in the rest of the world, if you file a frivolus lawsuit and the other person wins, then you must pay their legal fees

which pretty much put an end to nonsense lawsuits everywhere else on the planet
thats possible - can you wire separate PWM cables to the two victors? instead of the Y cables?
Above is Team 527's TORk...our robot for 2004. The wiring needs to be cleaned up a little, but all the major components have been tested and seem to work effectively. Extra points for anyone who can guess how that skinny little arm can lift our robot. (Hint: What seems out of place in that picture?)
yea we can scoop up the balls pretty well, storing up to 9 at a time and we drop them all directly into the corral.   and my human player skillz are L337 :D

Well obvuiusly the cylinder looks out of place, I still don't see how this all works.
do you have the fans hooked up on the victors? maybe they are overheating and going into thermal shutdown?

Ive never heard of this happening before - not with a motor that has nothing connected to its driveshaft
oh, wait - by any chance do you have the pwm wires tiewrapped to the power wires going to the victors? so they run together their entire length?

you need to keep the pwm cables away from the power wires as much as possible.
Alright, I've read that answer 15 times and I'm still not getting it.  What wire should I use, a PWM?  Do we hook it directly to port 18, so that we would use no spike inbetween?
I'm guessing with the empty bracket, cylinder, and all that wiring that there will be more to it. I like the goal hook, definitely something other robots might have to watch out for on the field. :p
And I thought the tape was hiding your secret gear ratios. :p

Is that a tank drive? I notice each wheel is driven independently. I guessing two of the motors are "driven" together in the program.


We are a rookie team and we have noobies working on the C code.
We see the code for 1 joystick drive i.e.

/*---------- 1 Joystick Drive ----------------------------------------------
*--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  This code mixes the Y and X axis on Port 1 to allow one joystick drive.
*  Joystick forward  = Robot forward
*  Joystick backward = Robot backward
*  Joystick right    = Robot rotates right
*  Joystick left     = Robot rotates left
*  Connect the right drive motors to PWM13 and/or PWM14 on the RC.
*  Connect the left  drive motors to PWM15 and/or PWM16 on the RC.
*/
pwm13 = pwm14 = Limit_Mix(2000 + p1_y + p1_x - 127);
pwm15 = pwm16 = Limit_Mix(2000 + p1_y - p1_x + 127);

etc....

This is a 4 motor robot and we need one joystick to control the left side and a second joystick to control the right side.
HELP US PLEASE!!!! WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE ARE DOING!!!  :ahh:  :ahh:

Thanks,
A Rookie Team




Ok i can help you.  Just tell me what ports your joysticks are connected to and what PWMs your motors are connected to, and i'll tell you what to change.
in the default code, the outputs are mapped to:

pwm01 = p1_y;
pwm02 = p2_y;
pwm03 = p3_y;
pwm04 = p4_y;
pwm05 = p1_x;
pwm06 = p2_x;
pwm07 = p3_x;
pwm08 = p4_x;
pwm09 = p1_wheel;
pwm10 = p2_wheel;
pwm11 = p3_wheel;
pwm12 = p4_wheel;

so you could simply use the Y cables and put the two right motors on pwm01 and the two left motors on pwm02

or edit the code above to put the same signal on two outputs - if you want your right motors on pwm1 and pwm2 and your left motors on 3 and 4, change it to

pwm01 = p1_y;
pwm02 = p1_y;
pwm03 = p2_y;
pwm04 = p2_y;

BTW - this code is in the file user_routines.c - after you edit it you have to pull down the menu and 'make' your code (let it compile)

PS- make a backup copy of your default code somewhere first :^)

Now, the joystick going into Port 1 of the OI will control your left motors and the joystick into port 2 will control the right motors.. assuming of course that the left motors are plugged into pwm13 and pwm14, and the right motors are plugged into pwm15 and pwm16. That help you out any? Two joystick drive is usually just a direct output from the joystick to the PWMs.. its the one stick code that takes a bit of work.


So just use the same values for both and it should work fine?



Yes, as long as they are mechanically geared pretty close at their free speed, then just set them both to the smae walue, and it will work well enough.  There is always room for improvement, but it will work.
I'm confused, is this team 47's bot or team 691's? I like the frame btw, but it could use a paint job

no paint....powder coat that sucker if your gonna do something to it....
Wow, very very nice.


We used this last year. As long as the regulator is set at 60 psi, it is legal.

Just a word of cuation if it werd: if you are using the setup, make sure that the tubes are the SAME LENGTH, so the same ammount of airflow goes into each cylinder at the same time and rate.



I can categorically say that no matter how careful you are about tube lengths and such, you will never get the pistons to actuate at exactly the same time.  You'll probably get it close in most cases, but air is like water.  It follows the path of least resistance.  One of your cylinders is going to have less resistance, friction, etc and it's going to actuate faster.  Or if one of your cylinders is beeing blocked by something, it won't push against the offending object until the second cylinder is full.
The good news is that the cylinders will end up exactly where they should be in end end anyways.
Have you decided about releasing the source code yet.  I noticed that you have left out the userbytes.  Any reason?

i've kinda thought about going into the field of engineering, but it really doesnt seem like something i'd want to do all of my life.  there are about a million different things i've wanted to do in my life, from being an astronaut (naturally since i live right by KSC and have seen rockets and shuttles go up all of my life!) to being a linguist to being an artist. i seriously want to be an **author** of fictional stories though, and i've been told many times since i was in 4th grade that i could publish!  ^_^; (i'm thinking about it... but i dont think my work is that good yet!) anyways, FIRST has taught me so much that would be encredebly valuable wherever i end up in life, whether i'm on the moon (or mars!), or in the Air Force flying an F-15 (-devious grin- i love fighter jets!) i'll still use what i've learned from participating in FIRST robotics after i graduate and move on in life.  :]

Nope...that picture shows all major component in place...although there is one small "thing" missing that would make it more clear what exactly the big cylinder does. Next hint: That's not the goal hook, that's the pole hook.

Try hitting reset...Its might work.  I'm not too great with the programming but we have to reset ours after every time we run it.
Is it possible in the future to "issue" the supplies or equipment to the team member who needs it or asks for it? For instance our team has an IBM and two Compaq laptops used for design and programing and if a student or adult wants to use them they have to check them out and they become responsible for them until they're checked back in.  Unfortunately it's also a pain or impossible to do for smaller stuff like screwdrivers, or wrenchs but a good idea for high priced and difficult to replace stuff. Another suggestion would be could you put a camera by the entrance/exit where you meet. You could even put a "dummy" camera there and not tell them that it's fake, all it has to do is get them thinking that they might get caught. Also is there enough supervision in your work area? From what you mentioned it sounds like they're taking the stuff for the thrill or, like was mentioned above, to pawn it. I can't figure out what someone would want $200 worth of safety glasses for.

how much does it weigh  looks to be over by a few pounds
If I'm reading the flow chart correctly and what a pressure transducer is used for, I would say it is not legal to be used.

No energy sources other then the battery may be used, and it is a custom pneumatic part not from this year or previous, so it is not legal by these standards either.
I rendered from max as a uncompressed .mov and then encoded it as a dv/dvspro-ntsc .mov in premiere should i do it in any other way because it looks bad, that is image quality.

My apologies.  I did not mean to insinuate favoritism.  That thread truly had run it's course.  Everybody has an opinion.  But in truth, the only opinion that matters is the official one from FIRST.  And since the question was finally posted to the Q & A system, it is only a matter of time....

Team 393 has been known to have "work-overs" (compared to sleepovers) the last weekend of build season.  Team members come to school on Friday night and don't leave until midnight on Sunday.  Sleep doesn't happen much...but we get a lot done.  When we do sleep, we sleep in the gym on mats.  It's FUN!

We also have an annual Capture the Flag party at one of our member's house.  We play this great game....in the complete dark...on about 15 acres of land.  It's always a great time when 234 comes (my husband's team)...we have a great time.  Some of the kids from BOTH TEAMS "broke" into our house last year (which is across the road), stole all of our toilet paper, and TP'd our house with our TP!!  (Though it wasn't fun to clean up, it was really funny!)
That'd wreak havoc with IR sensors.
those are cool!
Is the battery actually attached to that dude?
ok i am trying to think what i can say without getting into troble and as you can see i can not ever spell right tonight
Ummm..  the 6 AWG wire from the batteries looks to be just about right based on a random google search.  Check here:
[Recommended Current](http://www.alphawire.com/pages/383.cfm?partner=0&part=0)
As for the rest...  many teams will attest that the standard wires to the drills aren't thick enough to handle current right now, and go to great lengths to replace them.  I don't really think having wires that are too thick is THAT big of a problem unless you're really pick about easy routing or you're just that close on weight.
take the banner, hook up +5v, GND, and one of the two sensor wires (they are mirrors of each other, one true when the other is false), and plug it into a digital input. play around with it. when the banner sees the line, it will return one value (either 1 or 0), and when it doesn't, it will return the other.

look at the code to map which digital I/O pins are inputs vs. outputs in the default code.
i thought all the hints were coming from wayne himself....?
I had the same problem, except that I also found that when I exported to DVNTSC from MAX it looked all nice and shiney. We are rendering to uncompressed, playing with transitions and such in priemier, saving as uncompressed, and then doing the uncompressed -&gt; NTSC conversion in MAX. I have no idea why the image quality is so different between the two programs, but oh well.

Please keep us updated




Bree was terrified, as were her teammates. Nothing broken, she was sobbing with pain and fear at length, then talking. Paramedics said she's fine, but it's like she was pummelled by football players. She's at emergency now just in case.
They've judged by the end of all motion on the field in previous years(as previously mentioned). So my bet is, you wont get the points.
There may not be a single solution here, but rather a combination of factors.  Many of these have been mentioned and I'll add a few ideas.

1.  The drill motors (even in low) with the supplied gears and the 12 inch wheels are not a combination suited for motor effeciency and non-tripping action.  Having said that, you can still use them, but you must be very careful (as you are seeing).

2.  Even when EVRYTHING is corrected, you probably do not want to drive this combination more than 1/2 power.  The good news is that even at 1/2 power (easy software fix, with a button to over ride in an emergency) you will move around the field quite fast.

3.  From your photos, it appears there is lots of metal / plastic "dust" on the gearbox housings - something is wearing that shouldn't be.  You need to find that and fix it (especially on the right side).

4.  It is hard to tell from the photos, but are you using 6 Bearings on each side?  The resolution gives when zooming, but it looks like some bearings might not be used in your gearbox.

5.  Be careful that you do not contort the plastic gearbox mounts when tightening things down.  These plastic mounts are designed to fit over the 2x4 AL beam in the kit - they have small cut outs to fit.  If you tighten up on the mounts too much, you can distort the mount (i.e. cause misalignment) AND press the bearings against the frame.  Also I'd use Nylock nuts to avoid having things work free (and leading to more alignment issues).

6.  Again, it is hard to tell from the photo, but it looks like the left outside gear box is bowed out.  If so, a likely cause is a spacer that is a bit too large (and associated misalignment).

7.  You have to be VERY careful with the key on the gears.  If it is a bit too long, it will work its way under the spacer, leading to additional unwanted wear.  You have to be very careful that thess keys are EXACTLY the correct length.

8.  The 3 spacers used to center the large gear can lead to unwanted problems.  Better to use a single spacer of the correct length.

9.  Your motors are having a difficult time dumping the heat they build up.  Can you provide some air route from above the motors?  As mentioned earlier, fans would help as well.  You also might want to add some cooling fins to the motor case (be careful not to cover any existing air holes on the case).  Finally, the plastic mounting frames act as a good electrical and thermal insulator.  If there is a way you could use your robot frame as a heat sink (i.e. some good hunks of metal between your motors and the extruded AL) you can pull off some of the built up heat.  Again - this is patch to a more fundamental problem (i.e. this combination not being efficient).

10.  When your system is running, be very cautious of the motor temperatures.  With this combination of systems you cannot run the design for long periods without giving the motors a chance to cool down.  Stop every 2 minutes of use (the time of a match) and check the motors - if you can't hold a finger to the case for x seconds - stop ( the larger the x you set the better off you will be).  You must pay attention to this, or even worse things start to happen (things that don't reset with time).

11.  Your design has the motors / gearbox mounted such that they are "out of sight - out of mind" - no problem with their location, but don't adopt that thought process.  The drive motors / gears are the most important part of your robot.  Even though they are hard to see in your design, spend time (regularly and often) inspecting them to detect problems that might be starting but are not yet critical.

Again, there are many layers to the situation at hand.  If you are still having problem, take up some of the other local teams for help as soon as you can.

For the problems you are experiencing, you might say "am there - am doing that" with regards to some of my comments  (see the link....)

Feel free to email me if you are still running into problems - Vince"am there... am doing that....."](http://www.cgateamusa.org/gallery/albums.php)
Wow thats terrible.  Ill pray to allah.
I assume you can take the 2x ball off the goals. Also, note that the mobile goals start with the 2x balls on them, so if you couldnt take them off, the mobile goals become totally pointless(the large ball prevents any small balls from getting in). Also if you couldnt take them off, teams could simply cap their opponents goal early, preventing them from obtaining many points other than the bar hang. So, in an effort to have higher scoring, and in turn more exiting and appealing games, I beleive that the 2x balls can by removed from the goal.
2 people from 86 will be able to come for sure (well...Mandy wont get much of a choice and I'm sure she and I want to stay out of her bro's apartment as much as possible) count us in :D


Hey guys i have been getting alot of requests about our robot pics and we will display them in about 4 or 5 days.  We are putting so finshing toushes on it right now.  Hmmmmmm should i give a hint of what it does???????




Well, I think I know what team 25 is up to this year...and frankly, if I am right...I'm scared to death.  Of course, I have no evidence to back up my claims, just the basic knowledge that if there are any team who can pull of the improbable or downright impossible, its those crazy Raider Robotix people.

My hint for what I think team 25 does...

Ramp bot....but not the way you think
Do whatever the human player is the best at. Ours does a jump shot, soccer hybrid thing. Also, note that bouncing isnt reliable, cus their will be balls and robots running around on the field, so it might hit something. Plus the flexability of te goalposts allows shots to go in from the front. In other words, PRACTICE, and find which one is the best.
9 of them, you say? cool.  just one thing though, can't you only fit 5 (maybe 6) balls into the ball corral at a time?  or i could be wrong (happens alot).

I dont think anyone will stop you from using tape for your team numbers, but it would look kinda sloppy. Consider the fact that good looking or unique looking robots do stick in peoples minds, so it can be a powerful tool to get yourself to be picked as an alliance partner. Minor details once again can pay off.

I was just wondering why would you need more than 9"x42"? That's a lot of space.
The reputation points also seem to punish you for making mistakes.  I don't know about you guys, but I'm rather klutzy.  It's not all that easy to accidentally post to the wrong thread, but I don't see why your reputation should be sullied for a mistake.  Maybe it should be called something else, like "reliability score" or "klutz factor"  :) "Reputation" makes it serious, almost like a miniature criminal record.
If you can do basketball, its better, more accurate, but if you can't get the power, you gotta stick with the soccer throw.
Remember section 10, yes, that evil section 10 of the rulebook. It bans noisemaker and stuff like that in the stands, so electric lights probably arnt allowed. If they are, you're certainly pushing the boudaries of the rules.
Overall a very nice design. One nit-picking detail, though - in your menu, is the Calculator item supposed to have an area much larger than the rest?

Of course, could be a browser bug (I use Apple's Safari for _almost_ everything), but it takes away from the professionalism just a touch.

Other'n that, very schnazzy design. Simple, functional, but complex enough to look cool :)
for the full cockpit flight simulator, obviously.

> f you can do basketball, its better, more accurate, but if you can't get the power, you gotta stick with the soccer throw.

We've found it to be quite the opposite. The basketball is more pwerful, the soccer more accurate. The best of all is just heaving it with one hand, LOTS of power, good accuracy IF you can keep it centered on your hand. Most of the time it will roll off the side or the top while you throw, sending spirling off in a random direction. Oh yeah, punting has power, not nearly enough accuracy, plus it endangers the field, jusdges and spectator(well the ones at arena side anyway), so youll probably get DQed for it.
Hey all, thanks for the input!

We are using two drive wheels with two skids on the rear.
(we're using skids cuz we thought we wouldnt be able to skid stear-have had bad experiences in the past)
Today I came up with a new concept. Put another set of drive wheels just behind the others. That way we have the best of three worlds: we have great traction, turning ability (because the wheels are close together), and we can drive in straight lines easier. Also it is narrower then the gokart slicks so that we can still drive up the stairs and make it around the goal.

Try my poor ASCI drawings

where
() = wheel
v  = skid
-  = frame

*current side view*
()-------v

*proposed side wiew*
()-()----v

This option would be very easy to add to our robot and would add only about 10 pounds of weight and it just so happens we have weight to spare.

By the way, who is your supplier for the gokart slicks? I've had the hardest time finding them on the internet. Thanks!

Thoughts? Opinions?

9 of them, you say? cool.  just one thing though, can't you only fit 5 (maybe 6) balls into the ball corral at a time?  or i could be wrong (happens alot).



its 4 legally =D (or i thought so =/)
yes, you could just hardcode the if/while statement... but I believe autonomous_mode is reset each getdata(), so you'd probably just want to replace autonomous_mode with 1, instead of assigning it

It's kind of funny, they say electrical tape can only be used as an electrical insulator, but isn't it an electrical insulator regardless of if it is near electronics?  I know I know, the spirit of the rule.  I just thought if we *were* lawyers you could use it wherever you wanted since it keeps its electrical insulating properties no matter where it is.
I'm terribly sorry to hear that. I'm glad it wasn't worse but oh, how frightening.
Our best human players have all thrown it with soccer throws... Nathan, Casey, and I were testing it and soccer-style is the only consistent way for the stationary goal. We got 20, 18, and 18 in a row consecutively with that (haven't tried any more). Then when we tried shooting 12 in 30 seconds (been practicing speed now), the soccer dominated even more because it didn't require as much time to get the feel of it before shooting. The basketball shot was only useful for the mobile goal when you actually needed an arc.

Ok, last year, the rules clearly said #s had to be on 4 sides of the robot. I put it on our robot's left, right, and back side last year. The fourth side was the TOP. Well, the inspectors @ Chesapeake didn't like that so we had to oddly mount it on the front (which had a big gap in it for the stacker) with markers, paper, and tape ... Based on middle school geometry, I would consider TOP as a side :)
Last year, we had four 12" neon tubes mounted on our robot - two red and two blue. We swapped the connectors between matches so only the neon tubes that matched the rotating light would be on during the match. It was actually quite cool-looking.

No worries Marygrace, I'm a physicist and I like building robots.  FIRST teaches so much more than just engineering - it teaches problem solving at many different levels, and THAT is true education.  It is the ultimate project based learning tool.
Its a local distributor but I am not sure where they get them from.  It was all by accident last year too.  We wanted knobby tires and after we ordered them we got the slicks back.  But the worked great.  I like your new idea a lot.  We do have traction problems but we need the traction to get over the step.  Good luck.
Well, of course you miss me! :-)
Hehe, just kidding!  I miss all of you a lot, too!  Caleb, Eric, and I have been reminiscing about last year's regionals  (memories that we won't forget, for certain...). It is disappointing that we won't be attending a regional together this year.  I'm sure it would have been great to hang out again and to introduce some future Boilermakers to our team!
I will try to visit when I can - so far this semester it has been difficult to find time to do much of anything but homework, unfortunately.
And, speaking of, time to get back to my projects. Hope to see you guys soon!

(Btw...future Purdue people...if you have any questions about Purdue, feel free to ask me!  And, a word of advice:  sign up to participate in Boiler Gold Rush!  It is a GREAT time and well worth the effort! [plus, you get to move in a week early] )


... As a result, we will be able to get slightly more pushing power at the same amount of draw, divided over three motors; it won't be a full 'motor's worth' more, but it'll be enough to seriously mess with teams that thought they were powerful. According to the current curves, after about 10-15 seconds at stall in high gear, our robot will probably nuke itself, but we do not expect this to happen in normal match activities. It was also mentioned that versus a two-motor gearbox, we are not overtaxing our breakers, but the other robot will be. We will prevail. Bottom line, six-motor drive is a tried and true method for Woburn (although I have seen two other teams do it). Ask anyone at West Michigan or Toronto and they'll agree. Just *try* pushing us.

As it happens, we don't believe a huge amount of pushing will occur this year. That doesn't mean in our minds that we shouldn't be able to do it. Maybe more on the gearbox later from the source, but we'd like to keep a little mystery :) .





I don't think the chain might break, but there's always a small possibility in low gear... Like last year for example, our three motor gearbox with our 25 chain was really weak... If you've seen us last year, every few matches, there was at least one chain broken and 3 at one point I think.  :ahh:

Good luck to everyone with their bot with only 6 days left...


Heh, those look uber familiar... like two of ours from last year, offset and with weight reduction.

How large are they? Based on the actual picture, I can't tell.




The OD is 9", the hub diameter is 2", and each roller is 1" diameter x 1.5"L.

Weight is 2.7lbs vs ~2.4lbs for the Skyway Bead-lok, but could be brought down to about 1.7lbs by replacing Aluminum with Polycarbonate.  It'd look like [this](http://userfs.cec.wustl.edu/~bdh4/Omni/Lexan.jpg). These wheels are BEEFY, but the pictures don't show it.  The roller axle size was increased from the Technokats design.

I wasn't involved with FIRST last year and didn't see your robot.  Do you have any pictures?  I checked your team's website and didn't see any from 2003.
Team 639 will bring extra chains ;)
Hey Caleb (and Hilary, and Eric),

How are ya' guys?
Thought you could write us some software for this thing.  Its supposed to tap into a wormhole, create a huge vacuum, suck the double scoring balls of ALL regionals in, and effectively multiply our score by about 8 million - got any ideas?

Stef, da crazy Kraut engineer ;-)
Lol, that's the exact same dimensions of ours...

We used Lexan instead of Aluminum, but we did use 60A urethane just like you.

Here's the pic/thread: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24526&highlight=639+2003+omniwheel
one big problem - it allows you to choose from speeds between 1 and 10.  there are robots in first that go much faster than that.  i would suggest you set the maximum choice for speed to something like 16 or 17?  i do not believe that there is any robot faster than that.

also, you could include an option for gear shifting.

instead of scaling the power from 1 to ten, you could simply have teams enter in the number of foot/pounds their robot can produce (much more definitive - what exactly is a 7 anyways?).  you could have two entry zones, for two gears if applicable.

another option is a description of the wheels (this is very important in robot design.)  oh, and a check box for being able to climb the platform would be cool too.

other than that, its a good database.  seeing that SOAP isn't online yet, its the only one available to this point.
I think it would be okay.  Actually I think it would be great.

Last year, team 34 had these awesome light up leds that formed a multi-color rocket, rocket city robotics.  I would love to see a team do something like this for team spirit this year.  You would need to be respectful but I can hardly see anyone getting annoyed for a light when your robot is entering the field.

I think it would be fun and show great spirit from the team.  I don't see any problems barring whiny, complaining, annoyed people.  The atmosphere at a FIRST competition doesn't need these people.  These competition are about fun and engineering and I hope no one would try and ruin it by taking a great idea like this and seeing it as disgraceful and annoying.

Do it, but make sure you take both your blue and red light cover so you don't get on the wrong team.  And don't  sit infront of a webcast camera.  Because those people can't choose just to set somewhere else and they will be angry.
Bring back the light.
25 mm chain saves a lot of weight, though i hope it doesnt break. We will have our pockets full with chains  ;)
Hey, Stef...Can we have one of HURCO's CNC mills?  PLEASE?!?!?

Er, I supposed you meant GREATER than 130lbs as the last choice.

We're 128.5lbs ... without the lexan which is being ordered. Should be 130.0 like the last 2 years :)

Thanks. I made a few of the adjustments right now, and will be doing some more tomarrow.

I'll be adding the other fields tomarrow, however its almost midnight and I don't feel like playing with the database structure at the moment.

Thank you for your input. If you have any other suggestions, I'll be happy to hear them.

Here's the pic/thread: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24526&highlight=639+2003+omniwheel




I see.  The main differences between our designs is that mine uses an external milled slot (like 45) for the axles, so that we can remove any wheel without taking the wheel apart, and has two rows of rollers.

I did most of the urethane work.  If you set up a jig, you can cut very accurate rollers.  The stuff is so flexible that the cutting edge of a drill bit tends not to bite in.  The holes we drilled with a .1875 drill bit actually came out more like .16.  That's a lot of stretch!  Originally the plan was to CNC the urethane to an exact profile.  Liquid Nitrogen can be used to chill urethane to the point that it acts like a much harder-durometer urethane.  I was all set to use that, but then the urethane arrived and we realized it was so flexible that the weight of the robot would compress it to a nearly circular profile.
More than 1 lb and less than 1000.  Approximately. + or - 870lbs.

edit:  Greater than 74 and less than 130.  We are still finishing some work so it should be in the range of 129.99.  We had better make sure to blow the dust off before we go to weigh.  We were 129.8 last year.
a number greater than what we'd like it to be.



As for the rest...  many teams will attest that the standard wires to the drills aren't thick enough to handle current right now, and go to great lengths to replace them.  I don't really think having wires that are too thick is THAT big of a problem unless you're really pick about easy routing or you're just that close on weight.




Wire size and current carrying capability is based on temperature rise for a given size wire at a particular current.  Al of our wiring is out in the open and not enclosed in conduit so that raises the amount of current it can handle.  Also factored in are the lengths of a given wire as to how much series resistance will affect the voltage supplied to the load.  Again our wiring is fairly short compared to real world applications.  As to the blue wires for the drill motors, even if they were four time the series resistance of #10 they are only four inches long each and the insultaion is 200 degree C rated.  #10 is .001 ohm per foot so even at 4 times the resistance, 8 inches of #16 wire is only .003 ohms.  At 129 amps of stall current, that only drops a little more than 0.3 volts.
Whena a branch circuit breaker is chosen, it is sized to protect the wiring in that circuit from reaching a temperature at which the insulation will fail due to heat rise.  Hence the #6 is protected by the 120 amp delayed action circuit breaker.  The breaker will trip before current flowing through the #6 has a chance to heat up to the point of failure.  Like wise for the 40, 30 and 20 amp circuit breakers.  First mandates some apparantly larger wires for those circuits that teams have had trouble with in the past.  You could wire your entire robot with #6, if you had enough weight under 130 lbs. but why.
Those things turn so slick it would seem useless other than just to entertain.  How would sideways controls work.  Forward and back work with how you are balanced on it.  Would it just be a button.  Sliding down the sidewalk sideways.  I'm sure some cities have already banned that.  I like the idea it would be neat.
128.5 as of the other day before all our new spiffy speed holes we are having put in!!

Welcome to the big time!!


i agree that the hopper would probably be the best idea...however, these balls behave unlike any object i've seen in  a FIRST game as of late.  the soccer balls were fairly reliable and the crate were...well...crates.   unless you're rolling them with some tig ole wings, i'm not sure if anything else is gonna be that successful.  but i don't know...i haven't experimented *that* much.  i guess we'll see.  as for the pool cue...too unreliable...you'd have to be lined up perfectly which is much easier said than done.




It would be a cue coupled to a solid plate that is what hits the ball.  It wouldn't have to be super accurate.
I also fixed the entry page show the teams registered menu went in order of number, not order of joining (making my team the top of the list made me seem arrogent ;) )


I know nothing about programming but can you use an accelerometer to measure tilt with the 2004 control system? I know it can be done in PBASIC but I don't know about C. Don't you need to use trig functions? Thanks.


Yes you can. Just make sure your accelerometer's bandwidth extends to DC.

-Kevin
does this seem like a bad idea.... no

personally, If the product I was going to produce would not be up to par with what I thought I could do, then I would wait a year.  You can't argue that you're being selfish in trying to win the rising star award, because that's a huge deal and you only get ot try for it once.  Also, since you're the only animator on the team it's really your call.  Working over the summer is an excellent idea, and your helicopter is showing a lot of promise.

BTW  President Bush had a policy of 'no child left behind' and it really sounds a lot like your title.  Might want to rethink that a little bit (just the wording)

otherwise.... keep up the good work.


Yeah, the claw is plenty strong if you close it all the way... we've already popped two of the 2X balls with it.  :(




Uhh .. we have?
124 last I'd heard.  We still have some lexan and a few other tiny bits to put on, but I think we'll be underweight this year without a furious round of speed holing.  *runs about knocking on every piece of wood he can find*


128.5 as of the other day before all our new spiffy speed holes we are having put in!!

Welcome to the big time!!




Speed holes A.K.A. "Access Holes" lightened a pound for us, but trimming some of the bosch tubes (that does no have a lot of pressure load) dropped us down a few pounds... :D

We're about 135 (?) right now with everything on...

About the blue wires, I was referring to all these anecdotes I hear about the drills unsoldering their connections from excessive heat.  I dunno what causes it, but I'm inclined to believe that it actually occurred if people say it did.
well, you probably shouldn't allow people to put HTML in the description boxes... try looking at the page for team 1020 to see what I mean.

you should run the PHP function strip_tags() on all incoming input from textboxes. also, you might considering running nl2br() on it *after* strip_tags to make newlines display correctly in html.

If I'm reading the flow chart correctly and what a pressure transducer is used for, I would say it is not legal to be used.




A pressure transducer is not an energy source. It's an analog pressure sensor that allows you to see exactly what the air pressure in your pneumatic system is - unlike the pressure switch, which just turns on or off based on a fixed setpoint, the transducer outputs a voltage that is ratiometric to the pressure of the system connected to it. They are indeed legal - in fact, you should have received one in the kit of parts. It's a little brass thing with one threaded end and one end that has three wires hanging out of it.
I have never known Bree but I am very sorry to hear what happened.  I wish her all the best and hope she gets better soon.


if you are using thicker wire than the leads on, say, the compressor, than the extension will not burn up, but the leads will.





Not if the 20a breaker on the compressor or spike pops first :)

The fuse on the spike, blows fast. We've discovered this while reversing motors REALLY fast (using old spikes and old motors)

Nice theme! and thanks for sharing.
I notice that the file size is 2.24 MB? I checked because I have been checking all the CA drafts my teams have asked me to review.
FIRST have asked that we try to keep the file size close to 1MB.


After I compile the .hex in MPLAB IDE I open the IFI_Loader browse for the .hex and when I click open and error shows saying: "Invalid Address: 0x0 (Correct Range : 0x800-0x7fff)" :ahh:

I tried saving the .hex in MPLAB IDE with a program memory range of 0 to 0x800 and I still get this error in IFI_Loader. I know it has to do with some setting in MPLAB IDE when compiling but I have no clue.

Did you include 18f8520user.lkr in the build? This tells the linker where usable memory is located.

So basically, what you're asking for is to have all the omni-rollers (and there'd have to be plenty to provide a smooth ride) be powered [to prevent sliding]? That'd be very interesting in terms of how they are controlled within the wheel. Thinking about space constraints, that'd be a difficult task for any engineer. Nonetheless, I agree that it'd be one cool vehicle... and probably one very expensive vehicle.
Oh I see, what I read about and understood about it was that it took pressure and converted it into an energy source/flow.
I suspect you're using some sort of clever cable-based linkage to allow you to rapidly extend and retract the arm to interact with the bar.
I like it.  I want one now.

If you could make a self balance dual ball drive that moved both with how you balanced both forward and backwards and side to side that would be awesome.

Do that and then make it climb a series of stairs.

I think that would impress Dean.
Er... you are only allowed to be running at 60psi. So I don't see the problem.
The pressure regulator is supposed to only go to 60 psi. That is the pressure in the system FIRST wants us to have for use in the cylinders. Put the regulators after the tanks, and the pressure switch will automatically shut off at 120 psi.
Last time I was there, we were at 109lbs and everything was assembled and on the robot. I think the team is gonna try to beaf it up so it is not too light, to around 125-128lbs.
we plan on putting neon tubes connected to a beat box so our robot glowes everytime it hits something.


Slightly o/t....never let me me bored on a school night.




hahaha .. i love it !!


can someone pm me and tell me what happened today ?? i missed the episode because i was at a meeting until 10 .. thanks !!
well it looks like i need to read better.  i was under the impression that the yellow tipped one went before the tanks and the other after.

are we aloud to use the yellow tipped as the only pressure regulator?


ok - am I going brain dead or did you edit your first post? For some reason I thought you were looking for line following code, but it says plain as day "dead reconing"

?!




nah i didn't edit the post but i still do need help im having a little (LOT) bit of trouble, so if anyone could help thankyou..
Uh, I think we'll finish our bot first before we weigh it... All i know is my part is 4.7 pounds, w00t
:D The Slide Hammer  :D . We tap the ends of our drive axels and use this to yank them out or shove them in. Works great and it is tons of fun.  :p

last year my favorite tool was the dremel because it saved my arms from a lot of the "freshman go file" times  :mad:
Good luck.  Now that is dedication.
No, you must use both. The second is a "precautionary" one that FIRST wants us to use, just to be safe.

I just re-checked the pneumatics manual and it states.

Regarding the Norgen regulator:
This Regulator must be placed in-line right after the tanks to limit the pressure to all working circuits to 60psi.

As for the secondary (Monnier valve), this is from the 2003 checklist (I'm assuming it is not going to change):
Monnier Secondary Regulator after Norgren Primary Regulator. Guages veryify system Pressure. 120 psi Tanks; 60 psi System.
First of all, you are my new hero. That was cool.

Anyways, I fixed that. Of course, your team will probably need to enter new information now, since I dropped the other stuff.

Thanks.


Its now thursday, and I finally made a descision to cancel the animation for team 1098 this year. Reason being is that I feel I don't have enough time to do what I want to do in it, I know that some of you would say "hey, just pump it out and turn it in." But this is my first year doing it, so that means that I am eligible for the "rising star" award; and personally, since I am the only animator on the team, I really want to win it......

Thats why I cancelled the animation, I could pump out a quick 30-sec animation with barely any sound effects, music, dialouge, or even special effects for the video work. But I know that it wouldn't win any awards....and personally thats something that I am striving for....

Anyways, now since I am going to be using the same concept for next year I think that I am going to try to take the animation part of our team up a notch. By working this summer on a 10-15 minute "short movie" of our teams values. And then by the time the 2005 compo rolls around, I can edit some parts out of the team movie and add some other scenes as well as new music and stuff.....does this sound like a good idea?

BTW, if you are wondering, our team concept is based on the the U.S. Rangers idea of "leave no man behind" and the U.S. Armys concept of "An Army of One". Except that they will be modifyed for our team (the G.I.'s) as "Leave no student behind" and something clever for the Army motto....

I am going to be rehauling all of my models, including working a lot closer with reactor and stuff (just think, a helicopter comes in, drops ropes realistically, dust flying everywhere, grass and trees swaying...clothes rippling.....) Anyways, here is a picture of my old UH-60 Blackhawk.... I rendered this about a week or two ago, the fully textured and "rushed" model of the blackhawk is at school.....

http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?action=single&picid=6316




Here's what I suggest:

Forget the deadline, complete your animation, and use it for PR.  Its good the get the experiance and it will help train you for next year.  This way you can also do the best job that you can.

If you don't have time to do the soldering (or if you're too lazy), setting your team number to 0000 turns autonomous mode on too, if you briefly connect the tether cable between the OI and RC after setting it.  You can't turn it off remotely though, since this makes the RC act completely independantly of the OI.

We were at 129.6 without leds, bumpers, a shield, sensors, backup battery, and team numbers.  All of that we figure weighs about 3.5 lbs so you can say we'll be doing a bit of lightnening.


Yes you can. Just make sure your accelerometer's bandwidth extends to DC.

-Kevin



DC?  As in direct current? I am a bit confused.
One of my current projects (non-FIRST, so it's sorta on hold) is designing an e-commerce site for shareware/independent commercial software, and you wouldn't believe how much validation form submissions go through. Suffice to say that just about any input is limited to only the exact characters you would need for a response to that. For instance, an email field is only allowed the characters "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@-_.0123456789", because those are the only characters one would need for an email address.

But the one thing you never want to let people do is submit HTML tags in any form that is going to be displayed back to the user.
What pras means to say is that you need one pressure regulator after the tanks that will regulate the air to &lt;=60 psi.  This wouldn't be the yellow tipped regulator(secondary regulator) but the completely black regulator (primary regulator).  You do not have to use both regulator but must use the primary regulator between your high pressure (120 psi) and working pressure (60 psi, going through solenoids).  You can use a secondary regulator to reduce the psi even farther if you want to but you don't have to use it.

You must however use the Nason Pressure Switch on the 120 psi side of your system.  You wire it as a sensor to the RC and it will shut off the compressor at 115 psi and turn it back on at 90 psi.  I don't know the specific specs for pins and programming but there is literature about it from FIRST or I am sure there are more people about who have a better idea about that.
Try putting the high pressure guage on one of the brass T fittings after the pump but before the regulator.  You should see it go up to 120 PSI.  If not make sure that:

1) you have no air leaks in the system.  When you shut off the compressor, the pressure should not decrease
2) you have the regulator installed correctly.  There is an arrow on the bottom pointing to one of the outlets.  The inlet is the hole directly across from the identified outlet.  If you pump air into the wrong hole, it WILL relieve the pressure above 60 PSI.

Eric.
Connect your regulator after the reserviors. Be sure it is set with the flow in the right direction (arrow away from your compressor).

The control system, thru the pressure switch, keeps the reservior side limited to about 115 - 120 psi. You must have a pressure gage before the regulator to show that you are staying below 120 psi.  Put another pressure gage after the regulator and adjust the regulator to 60 psi max.

You do not  have to use both regulators. The second one is an option if youwant to use two different regulated pressures. For example, one cylinder at 60 psi and another at 40 psi.

Take a good look at the pictures in the FIRST manual - they have detail and show a workable circuit.
The only reason I say you must use the secondary regulator, is because it was required last year to use both. Now I'm not sure it is going to be the same this year, it is only an assumption.

We were able to accomplish an omni-wheel-like effect today without the use of omnis.  It's so good, I can't really say yet how we did it.  What I can say is that we maintain fairly good forward traction while suberbely reducing sideways traction.




Sounds like a large nylon/delrin wheel with slots cut into the edges.

Forward traction is good because the slots in the nylon dig in;
Side traction is near zero because the nylon/delrin slides on the carpet.

Am I close?

So... Today...

The trip to Pittsburgh was interesting.
I basically spent 24 hours on the road, and it happened to coincide with my birthday. The interviews went very well, and it was a very positive experience. I got back to CU about 9PM EST and as we're walking into the building, Chris Carnevale says "John... I want you to remember, I had NOTHING to do with this."

So I walk upstairs, and Chris is snickering... following me to my room. He subtley suggests I should check chief delphi... and what do I find??

I knew there was doin's a transpir'in... but I really didn't expect this.

First off, someone on Team 20 happened to wander into CD today, and then showed my father (20's head engineer), who got a TREMENDOUS kick out of this. So yeah... you've made my parents very happy (and highly amused).

Secondly, I think everyone got a huge kick out of this... so I'm glad I could be of some amusement to all of you. ;)
(15-20 phonecalls between 11:30 and midnight?)
(30+ IMs/Emails when I got back?)

Thirdly, never inspire Aidan Browne to do ANYTHING. He's easier to be friends with when he's bored. ;) Aidan buddy, I love ya man... but you WILL pay for this.

Ohh... and I can't forget Amanda Morrison. I have something special in store for you. :D Be Afraid.

So thank you all for making this day special. I really am ALWAYS very surprised by community outpourings like this, and I really do appreciate it. You guys rock!

haha thanks a l0t! only one more page 2 go! :ahh:
I prefer soccer style.  Some people on the team prefer basketball.  Do whatever you like.
I'm sure only one was required last year.  I remember a Q&A question addressing this and them replying how the pimary regulator was the only required on and that the one with the yellow ring was optional if you wishes to drop the pressure additionally.

Sorry,  I know from reading the current years rule that this is not required this year and their has been no change since last year in this rule.
We built it but couldn't get it working yet.  It didn't show up in the camera but we built it exactly to spec.  We do plan on at least trying it.


I TOLD YOU GUYS NOT TO POST ABOUT THIS!!  :yikes:

Well... Just lettin you know that i am ok. I got bumped on the behind and thrown about 12 feet... lotsa rolling...lol. but except for a few bruises and scrapes, the doctors say i should be fine... and that tomorrow i'mma feel like i got the $#!^ beat outta me.  :rolleyes:  lol. not lookin forward to that... but i'm in a good mood, laughin at the whole thing, and i just wanted to thank you all for your prayers.


I'm so glad you're alright!! When I saw the title of this post, my heart jumped up to my throat ... glad to hear you're ok!!!

Heal quickly!! *hug*  :)
There's a chance that the theme will be changed next year and all your efforts will go to complete waste though. I feel your pain, I am the only animator on my team on what I was told to be a rookie team, although we are not since I learned we had a disqualified animation last year, this is my first year with robotics and such.

What I suggest to you is you do what you have now, and turn it in, it's probably better than you think. This is actually a problem I've encountered with myself on this animation. I kept thinking it wasn't good because I'd spent **six weeks with this thing**. After awhile I just wasn't phased by how it looked for some reason.

Your efforts over the summer would be better expanded if you got away from the animation and tried new things, even if they failed I guarantee you would learn a lot more than just sticking to this animation.

These animations can't realistically be blockbuster motion pictures in six weeks, considering teams of 30 people take eight months to make parts in movies that may only be five or ten minutes long. Being that you are on your own, next year I'd suggest aiming for lower goals. You'll be very competative with rookie teams, since the other rookie teams just got the program as well.
Well, tonight I did the final output of my animaiton (All animations were rendered uncompressed) and we did three different outputs. One was NTSC, the other Cinepak, and the final was MPEG4 (For reference of what it looked like in the uncompressed).

NTSC took about two minutes for output, the file size was roughly 120 megs, and it looked like I'd aimed a camera at my monitor and recorded it. We tried multiple settings and then differed to Cinepak.

Cinepak produced good quality at 80 megs with only taking four minutes to create the output. I was happy with the quality, although not a beaming beacon of hope like MPEG4, it was good.
814 likes to make bumpers out of some type of foam covered in upholstrey.


Ok we have a scene with GI, ALL of objects carrying raytrace map, around 300k polycount, and complex particle system with post effects. All of this takes 10 min/frame. You just have to play with the settings - it really pays off.

Umm...  thats lack of optimization. The procedurals can be easily rendered to bitmaps, and so can be the 12 layers of bump maps.





Why would I render layers of bump maps to one bitmap? You completely lose what a procedural is all about. The 12 layers of bump maps would BE what a procedural is. What you're saying is optimization, is poor optimization by decreasing the quality of your materials heavily.

The computers I rendered on were...

Athlon XP 1800+ Overclocked to 2 Ghz
Dual Athlon 1.4 Ghz
Athlon XP 1800+ not overclocked

The Dual Athlon created the fastest render times at about 9 minutes par for the course, the Athlon XP 1800+ overclocked ran 10 minutes, and the non-overclocked XP took 11 to 12 minutes a frame.

Don't you have a robot to be driving... on MARS???

Actually I'm really glad that our chassis looks pretty similar to yours (as far as I can tell) - that indicates to me that we must be doing something right.
When you're the first to post that this thread is over a year old!
(It turned a year old on Valentine's day.)


Rule R71 states that   I know we are supposed to go with the spirit of the rule and not be lawyers but I couldn't find a way to resolve this in my own head.  What exactly is the definition of equivalence?  Does equivalence mean the same part number, the part accomplishes the same task, equal performance, the same type of part, the same manufacturer but a different part number...   What?

I would like to use something from the same manufacturer that accomplishes the same goal and is the same type of part but it is a different part number than the FIRST supplyers sell.  It has slightly different specs that are at no advantage or disadvantage to us whatsoever.  For our uses, the parts are identical.  The only reasons for the different one is cost and time.

So what do you think?





I say good question for the Q&A...let them figure that one out
Wow. Your scenes must be very complex mine don't even reach a minute per frame.  Do you have everything happening in one scene? Also, what renderer did you use. In my experience mental ray is alot slower than the default scanline, and vray being even faster.  Too bad vray is very finnicky. I haven't tried brazil yet. Anyhow tell me what renderer you guys use.
You know you're addicted to FIRST when...

-dave
Cinepak is good in the fact that it doesn't produce as many artifacts as DV/DVCPRO - NTSC but it is as pixelated as 300*400 resolution.  good analogy right?
We really wanted to try it, but we still don't have IR Recievers.  We have a beacon though!  :cool:

Why don't you have receivers?

-Kevin
Lock up everything and everything, and give one of each key to the leader of each team. That way, you will always have someone with keys around, and you can then monitor things fairly well without needing to bother adults.
I think it would do more than just impress Dean.

The builder would likely end up very rich with a name well recognized in the scientific community.

As for the omnidirecectional machine using balls instead of just wheels.. [The Technokat's did it](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18772)
Some of you may remember, at the Midwest (correct if wrong) the above robot was loaned to team 909, as 909's robot was not completed (again, correct if wrong).  During a match, a team with a wedge-like frame lifted 909 about 4 inches, and one of the balls fell out.

Note on the thread "Patent Pending"..  the Technokat's have something with a patent on the way dealing with mobility via a ball-type device.  So if you plan on building an Ball Drive Segway, you may run into some legal troubles.

Could it ever happen?  Anything's possible.
Will it ever happen?  I think, probably not.  Although we can improve technology, we can't change physics or ignorance to the new technology.  People started a "Sue-It.com" (It being Ginger being Segway) to figure out how to sue Dean for his invention before it even hit the markets.

Face the facts, most people are out to get every penny they can.  Make something that they can make money off of, and they will. By any means necessary.
How about only one single ball for a segway. Now that would be cool.
or how about one with a jet pack and glows bright pink or blue depending on the gender of the person.. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

My last post covers the 'one ball' also.
I have a slightly different question.

Is the distro block required?  Or can we use a slightly different (capable of handling larger wire) distro block instead?  It isn't really clear in the rules wether this is illegal or not.  (thinking logically, it would be fine as the block we are using has a plastic cover, is larger, and we are running 8 guage wire through it instead of 10)

BUT, we could be totally off base and be required to use the distro block we got in the kit.

Any ideas?
Though we aren't using it on the robot, I think I may experiment with them once competitions end.
OMG I am so glad that you are alright!!! My brother told me about this and I felt so bad for you. Get better soon ok!!!

Why don't you have receivers?

We thought we had them when we requested our missing parts, but apparently we didn't :ahh:.  Do they let you add sensors to your robot after it's been shipped to your regional event?  Regardless, I think I'll order some recievers from Mouser or Newark to play around with :D

Although there has been changes made recently in electrical rules (i.e. the drop of the ground stud) the distro block is still in the picture  for the moment.  Keep checking the Q&A and Team updates for the latest.

Well, ever since I've been on the Technokat's I have dispised our cordless drills...they could barely cut through plastic!!! :ahh: Much to my delight, we recently picked up a good ol' 1/2" Makita M-Force 18V cordless drill...now this has to be my favorite tool. You can cut through anything with this drill...and it never bogs down! it's amazing. Just the other day I popped in a 1-3/16" bit(though the top of it is 1/2") for comedy's sake...but it fit! Ooooh yeah. Spins like a charm. Oh yeah, and it's got NiMH batteries...not those annoying NiCd batts that anger me.  :D
Last year we molded bumpers out of rubber, polyurethane I believe, but we opted not to use them, weight, etc. kept us from doing so.
Beat this ladies and Gentlmen .. As of last night .. Kilabyte weighs in at 145lbs :ahh: .. I dont even think Dr. Atkins can help.. It is time for some serious plastic surgury....
In 2003, we did not keep our compressor on the robot. We charged up before each match and removed the compressor.

You will need a place to connect (the shitoff valve is good) so you can connect and disconnect without losing air. You need the gage on the high pressure side so you know when you are at 120 psi. Then you stil need the regulator to drop you to 60 psi. And you need the gage on the downstream side of the regulator to show that you are at 60 psi.

Good luck with this set up. It worked well for us, but your driver has to remember he / she has only one or two tries with the pneumatics and then you are out of air. Be sure all lines are "filled" by operating the sstem a few times so that you have some pressure in the system - otherwise you can lose all of your air pressure just filling up 'empty' pneumatic lines.

We called our device our R.P.C.A. "Remote Pneumatic Charging Aparatus". MAde a small carry box with a handle and battery. It has come in very handy this season while we tested different circuits.
FYI: IF you want some really good, flexible 4 AWG wire [hyperbolization] 100x more flexible than the Kit 6AWG [/hyperbolization]).  PartsExpress carries some great stuff...this 4AWG is made up of **1672 strands ** of 36AWG wire! It's really amazing stuff. They also sell ultra-flexible 8AWG wire made of **675 strands ** of 36ga. wire. It's great stuff...what we're using this year. Makes wiring a lot easier.

**[4AWG](http://www.partsexpress.com/pe/pshowdetl.cfm?&PartNumber=100-194&DID=7) **

1)  Pre 99  In 99 there were multiple fields of play.

2) In 1999 the last year the pre-IFI controllers were used, the silver box between the OI and the small antenna was a wireless modem (also called a wireless RS 232? interface). The black boxes now used are probably almost the same thing in a slicker package.  Actually if you cruise the net you can get the schematic of the pre-IFI controller with a parts list.  (Probably easier /cheaper/better to buy an edubot!)

Hi all!  First off, I just want to thank you all for participating in 3 Questions over the course of the last 6 weeks.  I know that there is still a little under a week of build time left, but next week is pretty crazy thus why today is the last day.  So, without further adue, here are the FINAL 3 Questions!!!

1. What was the first year they had playing fields indoors at the national championship in Epcot?


2. On the pre-IFI controllers, what was the device placed on the operator side between the OI and antenna?

3. Who was the first ever human player in the yellow position during a match? (Hey, you wanted them to be difficult right?  ;) )

Thanks to Tom Schindler for making my day tons easier!  He gets 2 points for 2 used questions.  Also thanks to the other Tom (Lish) for the other question, he also gets a point!

Good Luck to everyone!

3. Andy Grady


WHY does FIRST insist on using oversized wires??? I mean, I can understand that FIRST doesn't want any wires to fail, but if you are using thicker wire than the leads on, say, the compressor, than the extension will not burn up, but the leads will. That's not avoidable. Also, why do you have to use 6 AWG wires after the 120 amp breaker? If you have enough power to melt a 6 AWG wire, then it will trip the breaker. PLEASE TELL ME WHY!!!!!



Sparks:

In sections 5.2.6 and 5.2.7, you will notice that there are not any rules on power wiring downstream the speed controllers and relays. (This was not an accidental omission).

Section 5.6 contains guidelines for wiring... but they are only guidelines - not rules.

At all times you have to be compliant with the safety rules.

Hope this helps!

:)

Ohhh... that wasn't the half of it.
Not even close.

Soo....
Thank you everyone, for everything. :)
I really appreciate it. :D
I definitely didn't expect all this, so... thank you.

It certainly was surprising the kind of "fuss" everyone made.

Oooo... what was the rest then? Now I'm REALLY interested.
Question Fix...

On question 2, let me rephrase the question to read between the RNet and the Antenna, on the OI side and change the year to 1998.

Anyone who answered already can fix your answer if you feel the need.


Why would I render layers of bump maps to one bitmap? You completely lose what a procedural is all about. The 12 layers of bump maps would BE what a procedural is. What you're saying is optimization, is poor optimization by decreasing the quality of your materials heavily.





You will only notice quality decrease if you zoom in/zoom out a lot. In most cases you don't.  Why would you need 12 layers of bump map anyways?

I do see one case where having procedural with a lot of layers is justified - landscape. It is huge and you are looking at only small parts at a time, and procedurals add good variation to texture.  If this is what you were referring to, i agree with you. But for everything else? why?
Folks,

I know time is running short and panic is setting in... but please don't rely on "I was under the impression" or "This is what we had to do last year".  Please do refer to the 2004 documentation.

On the current issue, Section 5.2.9 clearly lays out the requirements of your Pneumatics system. (and you will be inspected against these)

As far as "legality", Section 5 is your primary resource, the Pneumatics Manual your secondary resource.  If they disagree anywhere (not saying they do) Section 5 would override.

Hope that helps!

:)

> Here's what I suggest: Forget the deadline, complete your animation, and use it for PR. Its good the get the experiance and it will help train you for next year. This way you can also do the best job that you can.

I actually am hoping to get some advanced models done by the time the compo rolls around, that way I can have some renders shown off in the pit, as well perhaps a clip of what I am planning to do......


> There's a chance that the theme will be changed next year and all your efforts will go to complete waste though. I feel your pain, I am the only animator on my team on what I was told to be a rookie team, although we are not since I learned we had a disqualified animation last year, this is my first year with robotics and such.


Yea, I was pondering what would happen if the animation parameters changed, but then again, its not likely, since it has been the same for what? 5 years? But even if they do change it, it will probably still be around the same lines as the previous years.....


> These animations can't realistically be blockbuster motion pictures in six weeks, considering teams of 30 people take eight months to make parts in movies that may only be five or ten minutes long. Being that you are on your own, next year I'd suggest aiming for lower goals. You'll be very competative with rookie teams, since the other rookie teams just got the program as well.


Well, i think that I have gotten more experience with the program than other teams, I have been teaching myself it since last summer, with Max5, and now hopefully I can put what I have learned to the test this summer.... BTW, another one of the reasons that I decided to stop the animation was because I was starting to have a lot of problems with my penguin rig, it never seemed to work, I must have spent a good 4 hours trying to fix it. Even in the end it still was messed up in some places (for example, when I moved the leg, a part of the mess would shoot out of its shoulder  :confused: ).......

Anyways, I am going to bring up the new idea, and basic outline of the short movie (now about 5-10 min long hopefully) to my team, and see how they want to do it.....

Wooooo-Hoooo!!!!! in just over 24 hours the practicen time will kickoff!!!!!! Cant wait Cant wiat cant wait. I love going to the scrimmage to see what the game will be like as well as the other robots, not to metnion work on strategy. The UTC scrmmage is one of the best pre-season comps their is in my oppinion with all the great robots that show. Oh man I am so excited  anway lucky us we get to leave at 6 (yes I know others our leaving early but come on it is a Saturday!!!!) but it is definately worth it!


P.S. Team 521 L33T CREW has also been added to the roster and apporved for competition for tomorrow. Just to let you know come on over and check out or bot see what we are up to this year ( are same old shinanigans)
http://www.acknight.com

Hosted by a company called 1and1 which had a free hosting promo a lil while back. The same package hosts our team web page, (which, actually, you can reach through http://www.acknight.com/chaos.www/index.html just as well as http://www.neverendingchaos.com - it's the same server). Their free package included 500 megs, 5 gig transfer a month, and a bunch of other stuff I haven't had time to learn yet.... ;)

Not much on my personal page yet, my free time is kinda occupied with classes and robotics of late....
Just wondering, does anyone know whether or not this years scoring system will work with last years controller?  My team is scheduled to compete at the scrimmage but unfortunately due to some issues we can only field a practice bot with last years controller at best.

Anyhow, I'm looking forward to the Scrimmage.  It was probably one of the best events that I went to last year...period, pre through post season!  Also make sure you come up and say hi as I will be dawning my usual position behind the mighty microphone.  See ya there!

Good Luck,

Without having them built yet I can not give you a definate but we were thinking you could get max of possibly like 12 into the corral and on top.  Becuase they start you off with 3 on top and it looks like you might be able to get 4 up there and it looks like you could probably get 8 or so into the corral itself.  Altho if that isn't the case you can definately get like 9 or so because you have the area up top for 3 and then the corral can go 2 deep so.
Hey Mister, just a suggestion, the more sensors you have on your robot for line following, the more accurate, and the faster you can run it.  We're using 9 sensors and we can run at almost full speed with about a 95% of the time staying on the line.
Wowser, and to think originally some of my team wanted to only do two and we had to convince them three was better. Thanks for the information Catastrophy I'll probably try and work somethign like that during the offseason but right now with the little time we have left we will probably stick with three unless a miracle happens. Thanks for the info though, I would love to try something like that.


P.S. if you are at Nats do you think me and one of my other programmers could swing by your booth to check it out? P.M. me


take the banner, hook up +5v, GND, and one of the two sensor wires (they are mirrors of each other, one true when the other is false), and plug it into a digital input. play around with it. when the banner sees the line, it will return one value (either 1 or 0), and when it doesn't, it will return the other. look at the code to map which digital I/O pins are inputs vs. outputs in the default code.




This is incorrect. The Banner sensors need between 10 and 20V power supply so you will have to connect them to a 20 amp breaker. Its ok to power more than one sensor from a single breaker. Connect the BROWN lead from all of the sensors to +12V. For each sensor, connect the BLUE lead to the ground pin on the RC and the WHITE lead to the sig pin. The WHITE lead is the normally closed side, so the RC will see a 0 when the sensor does not see the line and a 1 when it does.

I haven't looked into it, but the sensors in this years kit are different than previous years. I don't know if they can be used to see the line or not.

Don't quote me on this but I believe that they are backwards compatiable.

I was wonder however if they will be a taped digitzed version on the web like there was last year.


About the blue wires, I was referring to all these anecdotes I hear about the drills unsoldering their connections from excessive heat.  I dunno what causes it, but I'm inclined to believe that it actually occurred if people say it did.



Kevin,
Believe it!  The quality control on the wire solder job is not very good.  If you run the motors (in practice) long enough to get the brush assy. hot, the wires do start to melt the solder.  Since the connection is not a good mechanical one first, the connection series resistance rises as the solder melts making the problem worse.  Sort of a domino effect.

Aidan, I am missing something.  Table 5.2: Minimum Wire Size and Protection by Device Type in Section 5.6.2: Wire Size, lists the minimum wiring sizes for devices and controllers.  Are you saying this is a guidline?

Newark has some superflexible wire that is zip cord #10, red paired with black, part # 24-1930 for the 100' roll, about $35/roll.
I have to ask, where did you get the wire connectors for the SMC double solenoids? I had a hell of a time trying to order some more of those solenoids from a distributor (took me three times to get the correct 12VDC coils and submounts). Unfortunatly, after all was said and done, nothing ever came with those wire connectors to plug into the ends of the solenoid. Soldering works fine, but I'm curious where you found those.

Wiring looks fantastic, by the way! I just brought my wire organizer in here and told him next year, I want THAT.
I am glad to hear you are ok and I hope your feeling better very soon.

3. I vaguely remember hearing about the "yellow position".  I'm guessing it was used before I got involved with FIRST (1998).  Does someone care to explain?




In 1995 and 1996 when FIRST was 1 v. 1. v. 1 the three colored positions were red, blue, and yellow.  In 1997 the yellow position was changed to white.


Just wondering, does anyone know whether or not this years scoring system will work with last years controller?  My team is scheduled to compete at the scrimmage but unfortunately due to some issues we can only field a practice bot with last years controller at best.






Andy-
I just talked to the guy who developed the field control software, and the answer is it theoretically should; but it is not recomended since the newest RC has different software switches than last year's model.

Also, add team #177 to the list, just got off the phone with them and they are planning to attend...

see ya'll tomorow!

It's four feet across, so like 3 wide and then it was two deep so you can fit six in the actual corral.  You can pick them out of the corral and they don't only have to go onto the ball rack.
btw....displacement also takes a while.
Yes mental ray sometimes takes a bit longer than scaline it depends on the scene but i actually found that mray is a bit faster also the quality is like 20x better

also just having a raytrace map doesn't make it slow there are some other factors like whether it is transparent reflectivity....btw 8-11 hours is for scenes w/ much higher poly count.... 300k is nothing.. esp if you have trees and what not..., the car alone in the 1st scene is 300k polygons the buildings is like 70 k thhe plants are all very high too i forget the grand total ...
the PR idea is excellent and I can't believe that I didnt think of that.

And the theme has only been around for 3 years.  Before that the requirments were to just show your robot and the game.  This theme has gotten used a little to much so I would almost EXPECT a change next year, if not the year after that.
See the stupid stuff my friends and I do (including a new mini series about policemen staring me) at www.thedjshow.net :D  Lets say that it would get a TV-PG rating if it was a TV show :p
I would think that cost equivalence is one of the factors.  The rules make a large fuss about accounting for the fair market value of things no matter if they were donated, bought on eBay, fell off the back of a truck, etc.  So I think buying and "equivalent" part somewhere that's cheaper and costing the lower price might not come off well.  So you might need to use the price of the piece you're saying it's equivalent to.

Tom,

Would that be my good buddy Rick from WPI that you talked to?  Do you know if he will be attending tommorow?  Also, whats the line on my South Windsor buddies showing up with a modified version of the 2001/2003 robot tommorow  ;)
Whoops, I'm sorry.  For the aux bits, I was referring to last year's joystick, which is what I'm using.  Sorry
im wondering how long your bot will run on one battery...ive always been told the compresser eats the bat real quick
i love scrimmages!  can't wait to see what all the other teams have cooked up.  we will, of course, be vigorously defending our title...(if you could call it that.)
The team mentors vote to choose who go to the field...based on er....whatever they choose to base it on.  I think some based it on skillz and others based it on time commited and gp.  And seniority take some effect.  It seemed to make a good balance of things and the mentor are usually the least bias you can get.  The students would have to much trouble trying to choose in most cases.


I assume you can take the 2x ball off the goals. Also, note that the mobile goals start with the 2x balls on them, so if you couldnt take them off, the mobile goals become totally pointless(the large ball prevents any small balls from getting in). Also if you couldnt take them off, teams could simply cap their opponents goal early, preventing them from obtaining many points other than the bar hang. So, in an effort to have higher scoring, and in turn more exiting and appealing games, I beleive that the 2x balls can by removed from the goal.



In the Q/A system, it was answered that un-intentional blocking (capping or un-capping being the intent) is still considered goaltending.

Is it just me, or do you think that it's going to be a challenge for the referees, drive-team, and spectators to keep up with the amount of penalties possible in this game?  My guess is that many won't happen (such as pushing robots into the ball chutes, or breaking the wall plane, etc), but I think there will be a lot of goaltending calls early on.
Then I wonder if, since un-intentional blocking is goaltending, that alliances might shy away from dealing with their opponent's (2x) balls alltogether unless necessary for fear of goaltending, and focus mostly on their side.  Any thoughts?
ouch!  Man does that suck, but its good to see you are alright.  Hang in there.

D.J.
You do know that you are allowed to switch the fuse on the spike for the compressor with a 20A Circuit breaker, right?  I say this because if that fuse blows, with that much relying on air pressure, you'd be dead.  You could probably deal with one or two other things not working, but if your compressor dies, it looks to me that your whole bot is dead.
Our electrical team looked at this and wanted me to post about this. From their interpretation, you cannot have red, 'hot', wires going to the ground part of the spike. You need black wires. You can get DQed for it. I'd look into it more if I were you.
Straight out of the sheet posted on the whiteboard stating the requirement's for tonight's driver [and other position] tryouts... here's the excerpt for driver tryouts. Pretty much the same as last year:


> Every team member is eligible to tryout for all positions that they have not had for a total of two years.  The positions are as follows:
>
> 1.	Driver (drives the robot)
> 2.	Controller (operates the switches)
> 3.	Coach (advises the driver and controller and helps them keep an eye on what is happening on the field)
> 4.	Human Player (throws the balls in the goals)
>
> ********All positions are required to take a written test covering the rules (This will be timed)********
> STUDY www.usfirst.org/robotics/doc_updt.htm
>
> Some things the judges (college students, engineers, teachers, other adults) will be evaluating include (most apply to the driver, but some apply to all)
> -	overall skill
> -	ability to complete the tasks
> -	potential
> -	consistency
> -	speed
> -	seniority
>
> Driver
>
> ·	Perform the following tasks on the mock playing field set up in H Courtyard:
> 1.	Herd 6 balls
> 2.	Move goal from initial starting position to corral
> 3.	Drive up both 6 inch platforms
> 4.	Hang from the Bar
>
> You will be given approximately 2 or 3 minutes to do as many of these tasks as possible (We will give a more exact number after we try a few practice rounds)  The proposal is to have Yan control for all drivers for fairness (he is not eligible for the controller position this year)
>
> ·	A separate timed section will require navigation of an obstacle course on the field


I'm trying to keep a good attitude here.....BUT!!!!!!

Remember some of Dean's parting comments.....we're engineers, scientists, and technologists.  Let's read the rules and listen to the guidance as if we were....not like we're lawyers.  (YUCK!)

See you on the high ground.

Jim




I think that knowing the rules and studying the game is part of what makes your robot design and drive team work well in the games.  I read every rule at least 3 times before the we start building.  People shouldn't be yeld at for doing there homework.  If they were we would have alot of people failing out of school.


i love scrimmages!  can't wait to see what all the other teams have cooked up.  we will, of course, be vigorously defending our title...(if you could call it that.)




One thing I have to give everyone at the scrimmage credit for...you guys are absolutely brutal!  Last years competition was so physical, that teams were sending their brand spankin new robots back to the shop in pieces before the first regional ever even started!  I remember calling the match just stunned because you UTC people really don't hold anything back at this thing.  It was great to be a part of what has become such a wonderful tradition over the years.

Good Luck!
-Andy Grady
I dont mean to be beating a deadhorse ( well really a dead post) but litterally ANYTHING that somebody out there in CD land would EXTREMLY help us with our dead reaconing. So plz if anybody could give us  SOMETHING on dead reakoning we all would be very much appreciative... :ahh:

P.S. I'll hook ya up at UTC regionals or Nats with some trinkets or stuff if it works or helps
Im going to make drawings in study hall of how I would make an omni-segway.  Ill try to post them later.


Our electrical team looked at this and wanted me to post about this. From their interpretation, you cannot have red, 'hot', wires going to the ground part of the spike. You need black wires. You can get DQed for it. I'd look into it more if I were you.




that would make no sence. what the spike does is alternate which wire is hot.  so lets say you have one black and one red. i fwd erd might be hot and black grnd.  then in rev black is hot and red is grnd.  you would need magic color changing wires to have such a thing.

i did look it up by the way and there is no regulation for the after part of the spike, seeinng as the things connected dont have defined + and - and the output switches back and forth
my interpretation of the rule is that there the 2x ball is open game because if it wasnt then wat if a robot accidently hit a goal hard enough so that the ball fell off. then it wouldnt be fair to penalize them for an accident
We physically removed the transmission, with drill motor and Chip, from the robot, (no electronics), and hooked them up to our 2002 Pbasic controller and Victor 883's.  The Chips still skip.  Two possible explanations I can think of...
1.  the drill motors are backdriving the Chips and freaking out the Victors.  But, Innovation FIRST says that the Victors shouldn't care, our ratio is 3.5:1, which is very close to the ratio we used successfully last year, and I remember feeling the Chip twitch while holding it my hand, out of the gearbox.  Maybe I was hallucinating from fatigue.  We'll see if we can get it to fail outside of the gearbox again, and we'll try loading the Chip to get it to work harder.

2.  noise.  PWM's and power cables are in close proximity on both this year's robot and our 2002 robot.  It seems unlikely that we could so easily duplicate a noise problem on a completely different set of electronics, but maybe it's so.  We'll try moving wires to separate power from signal.

If anyone has any ideas, we're all ears.
Messing with your opponents 2x ball will definitely happen.  We plan on being able to take the 2x ball out of the opponents stationary goal and returning to our goal.

This decision will have to be based on the worth of that multiplier.  It the have 3 balls plus a multiplier and we have 5 balls with no multiplier.  It we can move the multiplier from there goal to ours while only getting 3 goaltending flags it would be worth it to us.  Not only would you gain more points, your 25+ pts + their 15- pts = 40 pt change - 3 goaltending (10 each) = 10 pt overall advantage, the overall score of the game is increased by 30 to 40 points. Goaltending in this manner isn't particularly detrimental to anyone.  Don't get mad at me for saying this again, but these rules kind invite this type of play.

I know I have to take there 2X ball and move it to my goal to win but as a side effect the complete score of the game is raised.  Another advantage to the teams removing the ball.  I would rather see them enforce a goaltending after 5 to 10 seconds of attempting to remove the ball or a single flag if the ball attempted to be removed and is not removed.  This would add the challenge of designing a quick method for removing the ball and not allow someone to drop the ball after nine seconds and get a restart on the ten seconds.  It would also get rid of more of the goaltending aspect since most teams would remove the ball within ten seconds.

Our team has tryouts. After the robot is pretty much complete, we have a time where each person who wants to can drive the robot around to do a task. Some of the mentors watch and the person with the most skill gets to be the primary driver.

Ok, thanks, that's what they said, and I'm not on electrical team. Thanks for the clear-up.
1. 2000 was the first time the extra fields were inside. There were multiple fields before then, but they were outdoors, just like einstein.

3. Seeing as how Tom posed the question, I'm going with Andy Grady as the answer.
What if it's something that NASA *has* discovered, but the government is covering it up?
i wrote a countdown timer in vb6 a while back, you can set it to count down to any day and time... i can send it to you if you want... email me...

I included it and it I am still having the same problem


If you want, [email="kevinw@jpl.nasa.gov"]e-mail[/email] the zipped-up build directory to me and I'll have a look at it tonight.

3. I would have to go with you Andy, cuz u always brag about how u were human player and that was when there was a yellow team...as far as i know :D


Just out of curiousity, how many teams have successfully built and plan to use a beacon tracker during the competition?

-Kevin



We never did get our IR Sensors nor the IR LEDs from FIRST, so we aren't going to be trying it.  We noted the shortages in the initial shortage list to FIRST.  We got our other missing kit components, but never got the IR sensors or LEDs.


ours is 9"x48"...oops...but Andy B. thinks that it's alright...hopefully it will be. I guess that I should have looked into that when I was designing it.




Oh well, we can just saw off those dumb driver joysticks...
We are planning on using the IR to hone in on the beacon but not to get there.  It is more the macro to micro thought.  Get close fast and then be accurate.  The IR works great though.  We needed to have a better way to attach the servos.  Duct tape works but is not reccomended.  And we needed longer tubes/blocks for the IR receivers


300k is nothing.. esp if you have trees and what not..., the car alone in the 1st scene is 300k polygons the buildings is like 70 k thhe plants are all very high too i forget the grand total ...




This is exactly why i said its always good to reduce polycount.  we had a very high resolution car model which was almost 300k, and after reduction it got down to under 80k with no visual quality loss.


DC?  As in direct current? I am a bit confused.




There are different kinds of accelerometers.  One of the most common kind is the piezoelectric (e.g. quartz) accelerometer.  These are very useful, but they can only pick up high frequencies, not low frequencies.  So if your robot was tilting back and forth at, say, 3 kHz, they would be wonderful.  But if your robot is tilting very slowly (say 0.1 Hz), or has stopped in a tilted position (0 Hz) you cannot use this kind of accelerometer.  You need to get a different kind.

"DC" in this case refers to the frequency content of the signal coming out of the accelerometer.


Oh well, we can just saw off those dumb driver joysticks...




I'm going to hold you to that, Greg :p
My favorite tool is the lathe that has a plaque on it that says " Conforms to the wartime measures act of 1940. For all those who are not Canadian that act was abolished after WW2.
I don't think they were dome shaped, but I could be wrong.  At any rate, I'm sure they were skids made out of teflon.  making your own wouldn't be too terribly difficult.  go to mscdirect.com or mcmaster.com and order some etched teflon sheet.  then you can just epoxy the etched side to a flat piece of aluminum that you can bolt to your robot.
They may also have been made of Delron, which is a hard, white plastic that is very slippery. You can most probably order it in sheet for, and then attach it to something, or you can order a block of it and cut it to shape. Im not exactly sure about suppliers, but you can check Mcmaster, MSC, and im sure a plastics supply company would have it.

my bad :) the sensors should still be able to see the line, though.

1.  Since it all was in tents and temporary structures, I have a problem with the indoor/outdoor thing.  Does a closed canvas tarp make a tent indoor?  Is
it which bleechers have roofs???

2.  The 1999 manual
(page 12)  puts  a 9-15 pin cable, Rnet, Right Angle BNC Connector, BNC Cable, and Ground plane  between the transmitter(OI) and the Antenna.
(There where two kinds of antenna or a limitting resistor you could put between the ground plane and antenna.)

3. I don't know if there have been any yellow human players, but some of them were pretty clumsy.

Here are my questions:



How many regionals where there in 1999?

Extra credit ---- where were they.

Extra extra credit  if the growth rate in regionals continues approximately
what year will there be 50 regionals?

Just out of curiousity, how many teams have successfully built and plan to use a beacon tracker during the competition?

-Kevin





Yes, we do have a beacon tracker.....it is a home design that we actually started two years ago. It is based on a rotating sensor picking up the IR off a 45 degree mirror.

We have it designed, prototyped and finally built/ We have the code written and working on the prototype. Out plan is to release the entire design and code to the FIRST community for their use. (we were sort of given the suggestion that the beacon detection might NOT be "optional" next year....)

Anyways, we understand the issue with reflections, so our software will be capable of tracking a large number of beacons, with a higher level piece of code (which we will also release) which does error detection to pull out the actual (real) beacons.

The output of the whole mess is an angle to the beacon from the direction the robot is pointing. (actually, it differenciates between the left and right beacon too)

We have two of these on our robot, and with each one triangulating to the two beacons, we think we can figure out exactly where we are on the field. (ha.....it works on paper anyways.....we'll see how it all comes together in practice)

Anyways, our intent is to post a whitepaper on it, release the designs (mechanical/CAD, schematics, BOM and code) and to have a seminar on the concept/design at the Manchester Regional. (and at the Nationals if we make it there)

We will be releasing information via our website very soon. (once we write it ;-)

If you are interested in what we are doing, you can email me.

There were 8 regionals in 1999, NASA Ames, Chicago, Great Lakes, New Jersey, Philadelphia, KSC, UTC and Houston.  Yeah, that's 8.

Using a 17% Growth rate, We should be at 50 teams in 4 years.
I sure am glad I didn't have to experiance "your" way...

I'd prolly start to drivew even worse.

And it's not funny, we did tell stef that he needs to do all that by saturday.

BENTHOS!


Don't you have a robot to be driving... on MARS???

Actually I'm really glad that our chassis looks pretty similar to yours (as far as I can tell) - that indicates to me that we must be doing something right.




Either that or you're both wrong.  :ahh:
As long as your driving is better than your typing, Ben ...  :D

By the way - could you get hold of that flux generator I asked you to get?  I'm sure we have enough protoplasma by now, but the wupsicity of the magotron core causes me some troubled thoughts ...

MVRT describes that as "Travis Wiring"!! haha i tried to do some travis wiring this year, but its nothing close to that. Picss coming soon :p
Its gotta be the heat gun, I mean there are so many good uses; Heat Shrink, press fitting stuff, warming food, melting/melding/bending lexan and a ton of other things.  But a very close second is the set of hex ball drivers.  They smoke normal hex wrenches.

Oh yeah, 5hp Air Compressors are fun...
On 229 we have a driver training handbook written by John and revised last year by Chris.  I didn't feel the need to really revise any of it this year so it has remained unchanged so far.
http://www.team229.org/resources/single/110
Such as with all the documentation on our website, feel free to use this handbook or modify it to fit your needs as long as due credit is given to the makers.

Beginning the year who ever is elected strategy head starts training a group of any high schoolers who want to drive, or operate, and has them drive around old robots just to get the hang of driving a robot around.  Then when the real season comes around we do some driver training with the fall drivebase on the new field with a practice mechanism while the new drive base is being made and then they continue to drive the new drive base up untill shipping.  About the beginning of week 5 I made the decission on who the driver, operator, human player, and all purpose backup is.  Now it is up to our field coach, John, to finish thier training with more specific match strategies.  The driver selection system works out very well and you end up with competition drivers who have a lot of practice with the robot before the first regional.
Ok, I don't have any exact code on hand, but our bot from last year ran on only dead reconing.  There are a few things you need to take into concideration:
1) Timing vs. absolute positioning
2) Does the bot drift?  Can you stop that?
3) Acceleration/deceleration and it's effect on the bot

Learning from last year, doing dead reconing based soley upon time is a bad idea.  Our primary problem was drift.  On paper, our timing worked, but because when we turned one motor wasn't powered, it drifted and threw everything off.  In other words, saying pwm13 = 254 for half a second isn't a good idea.

What I would recoment would be a way of absolute postitioning.  Instead of relying on time, give your bot a way to know exactly ( not using time x speed) of where it is.  One way to do this is by using encoded sensors (such as in a mouse).  By making your axis spin an encoded sensor that is hooked up to the FRC, the bot can tell how many revolutions it has traveled.  By using some simple algebra using your wheel radius, you can find out how far you travel with each revolution.

You can also do a few neat things with this.  For instance:
1) if your bot is stoped, and someone pushes it, the bot can sense that and pe programmed to fight back
2) you can use it to prevent drift.  If pwm 13 is @ 127, and another is @ 254 (simulating a turn like a tank), then the bot can sense if it's drifting and can either prevent it by fighting back or can make up for it.

So basically, now that you're armed with this knowledge, you can beging to program some dead reconing code.

You can (using coded discs) tell the bot to go x number of revolutions @ a certain speed as opposed to telling your bot to travel at speed 254 for 2 seconds.  I'm not sure how clear this is going to come across, but I'll be sure to check this thread again.  Feel free to PM me.

I have two domain names, [FactorFantasy](http://www.factorfantasy.com/)  and [DarkStory](http://www.darkstory.com/)  .  They are hosted by a friend, and so I have tons of space.

Now, for the embarrassing one, my first website... keep in mind, I was very young when I created this (okay, so I created it in 97 (tracker added in 98), so I wasn't that young, I just wanted to create a web page and didn't know what to do it on).  It was originally hosted on Erols, and when I created my new websites, I couldn't bring myself to delete it (sort of like not being able to bring myself to throw out all of my old journals).

Ok so all the CD people definately have to hang out sometime at the competition. Maybe we could meet at the team party or something. I have no idea what is around there and I don't remember the venue that well so does anyone else have any suggestions?

Also, who is submitting their chaiman's award there? I was just wondering which teams were.

(Sorry I edited because I put some info in that was not good soory!)





Team 60 will be submitting a chairman's there.
I have just discovered that although our graphics file sizes are small, my Word 2003 document, when converted to an earlier version, became HUGE.  Almost 4MB!
From Microsoft: Graphics are converted to WMF (Windows Metafile) or PICT (Macintosh) format, which does not support graphics compression. This increases the file size of documents that contain graphics.

I am now in search of an older computer with Word 2000 on it so I can re-do the whole document...

I hope this issue gets resolved next year.
Most teams have some sort of item to trade with other teams.  Buttons are very common to find around at regionals, however they are not a nessesity.
Over last several years, the trading tradition has gotten pretty big.  Buttons have been the most popular trading item.  Teams have really expanded on this a lot over the years by doing pens, keychains, magnets, candy... pretty much whatever.  With the no trading candy this year thats going to set some limitations, but that wont have any effect on trading.

Thanks for all the hard work Andy, it's been fun and challenging!! :)
If you want to use dashboard, the best thing to do is to make the dongle.  That way, if you see that something is seriously wrong or you want to kill the bot, you can bring it out of autonomous with the flick of a switch.  You can also disable the bot using the same dongle.  This is useful if your controler is out and people are bumping it, but you don't want to turn it off.  Disableing kills all of the inputs from the OI.
Buttons are very common, and a good way to get your name out too! VCU had a button competiton last year for a $50 Circut City gift card. Not too shabby! I think buttons or some sort of hand out is a requirment to get your name out into the public. If you don't want to do buttons, some other teams have done those static cling window things with the FIRST logo on it, frissbies, and other cool items.

But there is also now a second tier of team trading, almost an elit form of it. This is where team members trade über rare and precious items for others. This is the where MOE Sticks, Sparky Carabeeners, and other stuff gets passed around.
Why, whatever would they do that for?
I do, it just tend to check the forums about 3-5 times daily, usually somewhat regularly at 12:00 pm , 2:00 pm, and 9:00 pm.
Just a little reminder, I am only posting messages in here for people who wishes to remain nameless when they share their concerns/frustration.  Please don't be mistaken that they are all from me (although some might in the future).  That will make me the one with the most problems/frustrations/need to vent in the entire history of FIRST.

Also, since this sub forum is moderated, all messages you post will not appear until moderators approve them.  So don't be worried if your post doesn't show up right after you click submit reply.

Thanks.  :-).


If you want to use dashboard, the best thing to do is to make the dongle.  That way, if you see that something is seriously wrong or you want to kill the bot, you can bring it out of autonomous with the flick of a switch.  You can also disable the bot using the same dongle.  This is useful if your controler is out and people are bumping it, but you don't want to turn it off.  Disableing kills all of the inputs from the OI.




actually, disabling does not kill any of the inputs, it just kills the outputs from the robot controller to any other device, such as PWMs, et cetera.


About the blue wires, I was referring to all these anecdotes I hear about the drills unsoldering their connections from excessive heat.  I dunno what causes it, but I'm inclined to believe that it actually occurred if people say it did.



We experinced this first hand after driving our prototype drivetrain a little too much last year.  Check out this thread for my solution: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=131959&postcount=21
It is not easy to be able to pick a driver for your team.  Either someone has the goods or they do not. A driver will make or break how well your robot does.  For example i do not think anyone else could have driven our 2003 robot better then steve. If it was not for his quick thinking and great handleing of the robot we would not have done as well as we did.  This year was hard on us becasue we had to pick a new driver and train him not to over drive the robot. I strongly feel if you want someone that can handle the pressure of driving your driver needs to be picked the year before and have him or her drive all the time (mini comps) and durning demos to get used to driving at weird angles.  The driver should know ever peice of the robot (does not mean he is the one fixing it) and hows it handles, kinda like your own personal car (ex: ac does not work you need a screw driver to open you car door) **DO NOT BE PC CORRECT ** 1 driver  :ahh:.  I know everone wants to drive but it does not work. Just look at football when there is a qb conterversy it divids a team and nothing gets done.
You guys are sooooo dope!

Thanks so much, We feel alot more comfertable now, we were so worked up in getting the robot to  move that we had forgotten more minor things, like, getting to the regional and where to stay.

But we have most of that figured out now.

Good luck, and thanks for the help.

Charlotte.


I won't go so far as to say what our problem was, but I'll warn other teams to CHECK THE BATTERY POWER before you take out the gearbox!

(We'll check around for an ampmeter, but a fresh battery seems to have fixed the problem for now!)

Thanks for all of your help.



Did you guys get a fix on the problem yet?  Was Joe able to help out or did you find it yourself?  We are waiting on pins and needles.  Are you going to Greatlakes?  Then see you there.  Come and get me if you still need help.
Yes, you are right.

It was hard to do, and it only took 1 and a half days...

We've already tested it, and it's perfect. In the hard floor it "jumps" a little, but in the carpet they are smooth.


Tom,

Would that be my good buddy Rick from WPI that you talked to?  Do you know if he will be attending tommorow?  Also, whats the line on my South Windsor buddies showing up with a modified version of the 2001/2003 robot tommorow  ;)





Yep-- Rick will be there tomorow...

Not sure about the bobcats yet, i'll find out tonight when i waltz into their shop with my digital camera in hand :)

Just as a heads up: if those plates are made out of aluminum, you may run into distortion in the keyway after repeated use. We had a similar problem on the hub of a large sprocket we were using on our arm this year, and we replaced it with steel after noticing it was enlarging. You may want to explore this a bit more when you start driving.

Overall, a FINE looking design! :)

Matt




There are two aluminum plates on each wheel, grabing the rollers. The total weight of each wheel is 3,7 pounds, and (guessing) each plate is 1/2'' thick. Do you think we may experience problems even so?


You guys are sooooo dope!





i am A dope ;) lol see you guys at regionals!

As far as buttons go, how many should we have made?  There will be about 55 teams at our regional.
don't get too wrapped up in seniority....yeah it is a compliment and all, but if you make your drivers only seniors then the next year you have no driving experience what-so-ever....
I am aware of the 30 amp breaker.  It was temporary as we were wiring up the electronics, it will be swapped before we power anything up, thanks for pointing it out though ;)

And as for the solenoid wires, we purchased ours through motion industries.  We simply gave them the part number of the solenoid valve and they told us the part number of the wire.  ( if you need it I can look it up for you)  They were available at almost all of their warehouses, as the wires are compatible with a lot of SMC valves.

THanks for the feedback!
go to home depot....pick up some **"magic sliders" **they are on the same aisle as caster wheels, you got a few days left, waiting around for msc or someone else to ship to you will only delay you further.....get something for the here & now.....


You will only notice quality decrease if you zoom in/zoom out a lot. In most cases you don't.  Why would you need 12 layers of bump map anyways?

I do see one case where having procedural with a lot of layers is justified - landscape. It is huge and you are looking at only small parts at a time, and procedurals add good variation to texture.  If this is what you were referring to, i agree with you. But for everything else? why?





But if you render out those layers of reflections, bump maps, composites, etc you lose exactly what a procedural is all about.
I had thught abot the possibilitie of drifing as well as the costing from the winding down of or motors but i plan on settin a small revers flow for .2 seconds inorder to have the motor wind down quicker then turn.  i do need to know how to get a motor running for so many second then stop becuaewe need to raise our arm durring autonomous mode aswell as get it to swing to remove those 10 point balls and i want to have a backup autonomus just incase our line seeking doesnt work. I have been toying with IR but, im not exactly sure how to implement the IR beacon tracing, it seems s though the robot would not work as exact.

what i really need to know is how to: *
1. get a motor to spin for  X-many seconds at Y-many speed
2. get each line to execute at the right time.
3. get the code to execute 2 lines a the same time for differnt lengts of time and power

all of which im havng trouble figuring out, so if anyone could give me a hand i would appreciate it !!

Just to make it clear why asking to the event organization will not be enough...

The problem is that our buddies from team 1382 are crazy about energy, and they smoke one battery within 2min30sec. Fedex said: batteries are not allowed inside the box. Our team need more than two batteries too.

So, if we're going with no batteries, there'll be only 2 at the event, when most teams get 2 (kit) + 2 (event).

Thank you for all for this great help and support!


don't get too wrapped up in seniority....yeah it is a compliment and all, but if you make your drivers only seniors then the next year you have no driving experience what-so-ever....



That is the way my high school team did driver picking.  I tend to agree with your concern somewhat.  The argument can be looked at from both sides with the issue of senior driving privledge.  It is more fair if your teams goal is to let the job go around more but still be competitive year to year because you have one driver but never switch in the same season.  You also have off-seasons to train new drivers the next year.  The way we chose to run things in 03 on team 263 was but the two potential drivers each driving a robot in Bash 02' and see how they do and to let them get some competition experiance.  The method ended up working out but it only works if you have talented seniors, which you don't always end up with.

In favor of a tenured younger driver, you only have to completely retrain a new one every few years, and then thier 2nd or 3rd driving season has potential to be much better than the previous.  Up here on 229 we do not pick drivers based on seniority, the decission is purely on skill.  Our 4 drive team members are 3 juniors and 1 freshman.  2 of the juniors had been on the drive team in 2003 as well.  In all, I would suggest to pick talent over seniority, just as with your robot you would pick function over form when designing.  Each team needs to make the decission for themselves on how they want to select thier drivers.
Another possible explaination is as you noted in a previous post
" The robot had been running for hours"

Your battery may have lost enough "Juice" to start behaving erratic.
Watch the voltage levels....

Phil
The skids featured in kickoff were made of teflon. Comming from team 263, I have much experiance in this field since for 2001 2002 and 2003 we had 2 wheel drive robots with 2 (or 4) teflon skids strikingly similar to the ones in kickoff. :)
They work extremely well for quick turning and as a slider for climbing things such as....maybe a step? We used them in 2001 to pull the back of our robot up over the 3 inch step under the 14" bar and never had a problem.  If you are to use teflon skids, I would suggest reinforcing them with aluminum behind them to better support the wieght of your robot and if they'll be involved in climbing its always a good idea.


As far as buttons go, how many should we have made?  There will be about 55 teams at our regional.




As much as possable. Everyone will want a button from you, I would recomend 700 buttons or more.
can anyone say angle grinder...oooo....sparks :-P

To elaborate on what Rob said...
The actual decision isn't completely based on driver (robot use) skill.  There are many other things that need to be taken into account, such as maturity, calmness under pressure, responsibility (and many more).  The team drivers are often the most visible representatives of the team, and should be chosen as such.  Actual robot skill is almost secondary, and can be learned... maturity on the other hand, is more difficult learn.

We take great pride in fielding excellent drive teams, I am excited to see how this year's group (GREAT bunch of kids) holds up.

Hopefully by nationals this rookie group will be running like a swiss watch.

Our bot did a stack overflow reset the other day when we were testing new autonomous code. This seems like what caused your problem.




When the stack overflowed did the robot go into a reset state or did it restart? We tested it on the EDUbot by calling a recursive function and we got a blinking red program state.
On your OI you can set a trigger.



#define AUTO_BUTTON       p1_trig // don't quote me on the variable

if ((autonomous_mode =0 || AUTO_BUTTON = 1)
{
// Execute autonomous code
}


(I don't have the exact code in front of me)

Then All you need to do is pull the trigger and your robot jumps into auton.
Release the trigger to stop it. (great for stopping a run-away robot :))

There were 8 regionals in 1999, NASA Ames, Chicago, Great Lakes, New Jersey, Philadelphia, KSC, UTC and Houston.  Yeah, that's 8.

Using a 17% Growth rate, We should be at 50 teams in 4 years.





Close -  I remember it as 7,  The First Lone Star (Houston) was in 2000, you are correct on the other 7.

So 7 Regionals in 99, 26 in 2004  Means we doubled twice in 5 years.  AT that rate we should have 50 regionals in another 5 years.
They havn't addressed the robot colaboration thing yet. Grrr...

Seems like they have really overhauled the rules, this is a must read for everyone.

this is what i agree with most.  above all...your driver,  HP, robot contoller and coach need to be able to communicate with each other.  a lot of times the HP can get a better view of the field than the driver.  also, you need people who can take and give instruction to other teams.


This may be related, so I'm posting it here.  Using the FRC-INTERRUPTS code posted by Kevin, our drive motors (PWM 13 & 15) went crazy (jerking back & forth)  whenever we tried to enable a timer interrupt.  The interrupt handler only increments a unsigned long.




There are two different .lib files from IFI: FRC_Alltimers.lib and FRC_Library.lib. If you use the Generate_Pwms() function you need to use FRC_Library.lib. The Generate_Pwms() function uses timer0 so it is unavailable. If you don't need the extra 4 PWMs then you can use FRC_Alltimers.lib and have access to timer0.
Awwww ... well, at least you look more intimidating ...

Dr. Bot,

I'm pretty sure the first Houston regional was in 1998.  I believe that Chief Delphi beat the Baxter Bomb Squad in the finals.  Could someone verify this?


Messing with your opponents 2x ball will definitely happen.  We plan on being able to take the 2x ball out of the opponents stationary goal and returning to our goal.

This decision will have to be based on the worth of that multiplier.  It the have 3 balls plus a multiplier and we have 5 balls with no multiplier.  It we can move the multiplier from there goal to ours while only getting 3 goaltending flags it would be worth it to us.  Not only would you gain more points, your 25+ pts + their 15- pts = 40 pt change - 3 goaltending (10 each) = 10 pt overall advantage, the overall score of the game is increased by 30 to 40 points. Goaltending in this manner isn't particularly detrimental to anyone.  Don't get mad at me for saying this again, but these rules kind invite this type of play.




Well said.

I think this is definitely a useful strategy, and will almost definitely occur. A solid defense is going to be key.

Overall a very nice design. One nit-picking detail, though - in your menu, is the Calculator item supposed to have an area much larger than the rest?

Of course, could be a browser bug (I use Apple's Safari for _almost_ everything), but it takes away from the professionalism just a touch.






That may very will be the case. The computers here at school and my pc are both using explorer, so you're probably right.

I'll talk to him about that tonight.

I find the addition of all the specific penalties interesting.  I wonder if a lot of this is to give FIRST a more formalized rule process.  In the past, it's been a bit more relaxed without as many penalities avaiable (usually you could only be disabled or disqualified).  This somewhat leads me to believe that this is an attempt by FIRST to become more palatable for an outside audience.  We'll have to see how it goes.

Dr. Bot,

I'm pretty sure the first Houston regional was in 1998.  I believe that Chief Delphi beat the Baxter Bomb Squad in the finals.  Could someone verify this?




Karthik is correct with this.  In 1998, the southwest regional was held in Houston.  Chief Delphi defeated Baxter Bomb Squad to take the title.  In all there were 8 regionals in 1997.  They were...

1. NASA Ames California Open - Moffet Field, CA
2. Motorola Midwest Open - Chicago, IL
3. NASA KSC Open - Kennedy Space Center, FL
4. FIRST Southwest Open - Houston, TX
5. Philladelphia Alliance Open - Philladelphia, PA
6. UTC New England Open - Hartford, CT
7. J&J Midatlantic Open - New Brunswick, NJ
8. Great Lakes Open - Ypsilanti, MI

Edit: However!  Upon further review, we have found that Dr. Bot is indeed correct!  This is because the Houston Regional was canceled in 1999!  Thus all the confusion.
It is a sad thing that rule G32 needed to be stated at all.

Yes, last year was a lot of fun.  Especially the ride back from Chicago stayed in memory - after all the frustration we went through at those regionals, I was close to bail out for this year - but remembering the fun times made it all worth while again.  And I have not been disappointed so far :-)  Same headbanging, sure, but it is fun!

PS- why did they do it that way in the first place?

Yeah i was looking for an extremly hidden link...   nt something so ovbvious that could be found leading to the 2002-2003 photo of the year page...  Well our team has many wacky things we have done, some things occuring at public apearances, other happening while building including the exclamation point war of our field objects...
Very nice, good job.  It was fun to watch and you represented FIRST well.

The arm works too, our your multipositioning the cyclinder that lifts it up?  It looked like it worked nice.
Yea, I might be making a small preview to show at the 2004 compo.....

But I was thinking again, perhaps if I did make this short movie, I could have the animation be a "commerical" for the movie (which would be based on our values). And then, in the pits I can have like "showings" of the movie like every hour or so using a data projector..... And maybe even make a small 1-2 minute trailer to be playing continuously to get people interested in watching?

I personally think it would make a lot more people interested in the animation competion (and perhaps help FIRST realize how much time we put into these animations?).......

BTW, the trailers, movie and stuff would sorta be based on Black Hawk Down, except without the blood and gore and extreme violence.... If you want to see what the trailers are like, and what I am shooting for, go here:

We actually had a problem like this with a file called adc.h.  We just had to reinstall the default code in the right folder I think.  C/mcc18/bin/c18 or something like that I think.  This is all from my memory and I might be wrong, but hope it helps.


Why do you need to pause the program?
For testing purposes?

If so, you can code a switch, when closed allows the code to execute, when released if stops.



if ((autonomous_mode = 0) || (AUTON_SWITCH = 1))
{
execute auton code
}


Or something like that. (I don't have my code in front of me. :)
AUTO_SWITCH - is an alias to one of the O/I joystick triggers for testing only.  Make sure to remove it before comp.




First of all, that's a logical OR. You want AND (&&).

How about this? In main.c:


while (1)   /* This loop will repeat indefinitely. */
{
#ifdef _SIMULATOR
statusflag.NEW_SPI_DATA = 1;
#endif
**if (!PAUSE_SWITCH)
{**
if (statusflag.NEW_SPI_DATA)      /* 26.2ms loop area */
{                                 /* I'm slow!  I only execute every 26.2ms because */
/* that's how fast the Master uP gives me data. */
Process_Data_From_Master_uP();  /* You edit this in user_routines.c */

if (autonomous_mode)            /* DO NOT CHANGE! */
{
User_Autonomous_Code();        /* You edit this in user_routines_fast.c */
}
}
Process_Data_From_Local_IO();     /* You edit this in user_routines_fast.c */
/* I'm fast!  I execute during every loop.*/
**}**
} /* while (1) */



Basically, if you flip the switch, the robot will finish, and then go into a *really* fast loop: it does nothing until you turn it off. Be sure to but something similar in the auto.mode code: it has its own loop.
ps- It's faster to compile by hitting F10, it won't recompile what you didn't change.
Is the radio modem in the right port? On both ends.
We are in the home stretch for our animation. We may make it, we may not. But it will be done. We've worked too long and hard on it to just give up and forget about it.
You owe it to your team and yourself to finish the work you started. Awards are nice but they shouldn't be the sole reason you do FIRST. You'll be better for it if you finish the work.


But if you render out those layers of reflections, bump maps, composites, etc you lose exactly what a procedural is all about.

We finally found the problem.  DUMB mistake.  The drill motors were in low gear, when they were supposed to be in high gear.  The Chips were drawing 60 amps trying to speed up the drill motors, and breakers tripped.  20 or so hours wasted.  What a learning experience.

Thanks for the help!
the PINK team (233) hopes to participate in the card-trading game ^_^
The way our club is set up (ours is a CLUB AND A TEAM to the guy above), since we draw students from about 20 schools instead of one, its hard to find older students interested.  We had about 80% Sophomores/Juniors in 2001, but now we only have two seniors, three juniors, and about 8 sophomores.  I am a freshman, but have been on the team four years, giving me a *little* more experience than the 10/11 graders just joining this year... (nothing against you guys, you are great)  The annoying thing, not to be hypocritical, is the younger 7th/8th graders that got recruited, mainly since most of them do not show maturity and cannot stay on task.  There have been about three or four of them that come to meetings regularly and have a positive effect on the effort.  The rest of them I believe would have a better time in the FLL team...

I don't think 9 is necesary, but trim the positions of the sensors based on the width of the line. I think 5 would be good:


|   |
1  2| 3 |4  5
|   |



1,5- perimeter, just to make sure your bot doesn't get lost.

ps-the code was just to get a fixed-width font.
i need to know b/c i have a laptop mount in the control box area and well, it is too big for the 9 inches so i need 2 know if i can have overhang., at least with that dimension
heehee i'm a freshman but practically the whole team had said that i'm the "freshman who doesnt act like a freshman" to the point where i'm not even considered a freshman anymore, i'm "so awesome" that i'm automatically a 'senior' lol.  kinda.. weird but still pretty cool... i'm just happy the team actually likes me/accepts me for who i am. :-D

... I haven't looked into it, but the sensors in this years kit are different than previous years. I don't know if they can be used to see the line or not.




They are? they look exactly the same to me. The yellow ones, right?
YEAH!!! I'm not that studious, but I try to check everyday.
Aren't there some wait functions somewhere? those would do nicely.
I'm glad you guys like it :) Once I finish the animation within the next few days, I'll put a link in here with a 1600 x 1200 resolution and a 1024 x 768.  :]
I like port 3 for stuff like this: 1&2 for driving, 4 for a dial box, 3 for debug/advanced.
My teammate and i were thinking about that, i have a goatee now and i grew that in a week.  After 6 weeks of not trimming it, id have a FULL 4 inch long beard.  If i go out at night, i have to shave twice a day, i get my 5o'cclock shadow at lunch.   Plus it would itch like crazy
Umm... yeah, changing channels doesn't matter- when you're tethered. Problem solved.
hrmmm....i know that when the robot is tethered the team lights blink both red and blue alternally.

when we tested our control system the lights only blinked one color when using radios
Ah, yes. I had to fix that yesterday. adc.h is a standard header. Be sure to set the right locations in MPLAB. Project &gt; Set Language Tool Locations... This will set the default dirs. Oh, and delete the stuff in Project &gt; Build Options... &gt; Project &gt; General That way it defaults to what you just put in. And use the MPLAB locations next time you compile, a dialog comes up.
I'm glad to hear you're alright and hope you heal soon.


I know we are supposed to go with the spirit of the rule and not be lawyers but I couldn't find a way to resolve this in my own head.  What exactly is the definition of equivalence?  Does equivalence mean the same part number, the part accomplishes the same task, equal performance, the same type of part, the same manufacturer but a different part number...




Unfortunately, there I don't think there is any way to provide a universally acceptable definition to the "equivalence" phrase for this context.  It is much too application- and part-dependent.

For example, consider a resistor purchased from two different sources.   The measured resistance of the two parts is identical.  However, the body of one resistor (other than the color coding bands) is brown, while the other one is black.  Are they "equivalent?"  If you interpret equivalent to mean "identical" then they are not.  If you interpret "equivalent" to mean "functionally equivalent for this application" then they are the same.  For this application, the color is irrelevant.

But for another part in another application, color may be critical (e.g. a lens cover over a visible light sensor, which would affect the particular wavelengths detectable by the sensor, and therefore influence the sensor response).

One reasonable way to look at this is to try to determine the "functional equivalence" of two parts.  The MINIMUM standard I would use would be "do they provide the same capability, and the same output response to equivalent input stimuli?"    Because our robots are subject to such strict mass and volume guidelines, the parts may also have to pass a "do the parts weigh (approximately) the same and fill (approximately) the same volume?" test to be "equivalent" in the eyes of FIRST inspectors.

Realistically, if you are worried about this, you need to post a question to FIRST as soon as possible.  They are the only ones that can give an official answer that you can use if questioned by an inspector.

Mr. Watson,

Our team tried for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th weeks to get the trackers to work.  During this time, all the mistakes as far as documentation provided by FIRST were discovered, in specific, the mistakes concerning the wiring of the beacon, AS WELL AS, the wiring of the sensors.  I felt that I could trust FIRST's documentation, but now that trust has been lost.  After all the aggravation caused by the situation with the documentation, we finally had it so that the sensors could see the beacon when we ran "Tracker".

Then came the tough part of putting the heat shrink on the sensors and attaching the sensors to the servos, which we did.  They did not work, so we finally decided to give up.  I eventually ended up with the idea somehow, that we may have over-heated the IR sensors by blow drying the heat shrink.  If so, then the sensors are too sensitive.  Another reason for giving up, is that we did not want to have to deal with the hassle of mounting the servos 44 inches off the ground, which is double the height of our tallest tier.  I just felt like I couldn't trust the trackers.  I am interested to see how dependable they are during actual game time.

If IR sensing is required in future FIRST competitions, I honestly believe that FIRST should get its documentation straight, and that FIRST should supply specific instructions (and warnings about over-heating using a blow dryer) that will work every time.  It would also be helpful if the beacons were to be mounted at heights ranging from maybe 12-24 inches.

Is the material itself legal?  By following the parts use flowchart, I would say yes.  BUT your USE of the material also needs to be legal (e.g. if you are using the netting as a non-functional decoration, or as a basket to hold balls, etc. then there is no problem - but if you are using it to ensnare other robots then it would be illegal).

Hey guys i have been getting alot of requests about our robot pics and we will display them in about 4 or 5 days.  We are putting so finshing toushes on it right now.  Hmmmmmm should i give a hint of what it does???????





Dude, thats great but ahh.... your supposed to put a picture in the "Robot Showcase" Its called a showcase for a reason... i cant wait for your picture


First of all, that's a logical OR. You want AND (&&).






if ((autonomous_mode **=** 0) || (AUTON_SWITCH **=** 1))
{
execute auton code
}



Well, I believe the idea is so that the auto code executes if the team's AUTON_SWITCH is activated OR if the IFI controller inidicates via the competition port that the robot is in autonomous mode.  However, you want to be careful that you use the equivalene test, not the assignment operator--it probably was a copying error, but for those who might use it, make sure you put **==** not **=**.  Also, why the 0?  Do you mean 1?  (Hrm, or do you mean 0, in which case you would need AND, no?)  Also, see below.





How about this? In main.c:


while (1)   /* This loop will repeat indefinitely. */
{
#ifdef _SIMULATOR
statusflag.NEW_SPI_DATA = 1;
#endif
**if (!PAUSE_SWITCH)
{**
if (statusflag.NEW_SPI_DATA)      /* 26.2ms loop area */
{                                 /* I'm slow!  I only execute every 26.2ms because */
/* that's how fast the Master uP gives me data. */
Process_Data_From_Master_uP();  /* You edit this in user_routines.c */

if (autonomous_mode)            /* DO NOT CHANGE! */
{
User_Autonomous_Code();        /* You edit this in user_routines_fast.c */
}
}
Process_Data_From_Local_IO();     /* You edit this in user_routines_fast.c */
/* I'm fast!  I execute during every loop.*/
**}**
} /* while (1) */



Basically, if you flip the switch, the robot will finish, and then go into a *really* fast loop: it does nothing until you turn it off. Be sure to but something similar in the auto.mode code: it has its own loop.




Well, if you're going to all the trouble of creating a disable switch, why add extra code when you can just use the competition port to create a disable button as the program is?  And while you're there, you can create your auton switch too, and won't need extra code.  It will simulate the competition.  [competition pin-out guide](http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/Competition_Port_Pinout_Guide.PDF) [pdf file].

I'd carefully analyze why you want to pause.  But there are several ways to go about it -- you have a timer interrupt, so you can program a pause function easily enough to pause for a given amount of time.  A quick solution, if that's all you need it for, is just to have an empty for loop that executes some pre-determined amount.  e.g.,


for (waste_time = 0; waste_time < TIME_TO_WASTE; waste_time++) ;
// remember: declare waste_time elsewhere, and define TIME_TO_WASTE

According to the FIRST Q/A, you can over hang the 9" shelf.
Simply highlight the group you want to rotate, click the rotate icon, and i believe 4-5 circles should appear over the objects, each one of these is an axis. Place the cursor above these axis' and rotate.
Dave is right, the material itself is legal, as long as it does not entangle an other robots OR damage the playing field in any way.
Check out page 19 of the manual ([http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/8-TheAwards-RevA-markup.pdf](http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/8-TheAwards-RevA-markup.pdf) )
it says that acceptable formats are quicktime (.mov) and to the best of my knowledge those can only be viewed in quicktime's player.
Yeah they are the yellow ones. I used them for the wheel encoders this year. The part number is the same. Just this years does not have the schematic on the side. I also think that the sensing indicator led is a different colour.
Q:	Can a part of the operator interface not be on the shelf at all ? For instance a control pedal for part of the robot sit on the floor in front of the driver?
A:	Yes, as long as it remains within the boundaries of your Team Zone .
that is not a shelf.

it is a ball sucker, there is a roller there connected to the chip that can suck up and hold up to 6 balls.  and it spits them out really fast too (we're wondering if we'll be able to get them into the ball coral from a distance)

it can actually hold 2 big balls.  the wrist in the jaw lets it place one of the 2x balls on top the cage where it is cradled.  the claw can then grab another one if it the next ball is on top of a goal.  this pic is from a while ago, so its hardly complete.

the goal grabber in the back is configured so that it also provides a lever that lifts the bot onto the platform.  its pretty cool - its not the piston of the grabber that lifts the bot, but the motion of the bot itself.

we have some sweet new gearboxes this year.  you can see them [here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=25687).  2 drills 2 FP's, high gear 14.5 feet/sec low gear 8.5 feet/sec.
You can buy one from innovationfirst.com. You can also get one from a hobby shop, although you will need to verify the connector. It needs to be 7.2v NiCad.
A procedural material is a high definition material that uses multiple layers of maps, including bump, diffuse, mask, composite, blend, reflections, and much more. There's nothing else that it can be really.
The smaller 7.2v battery can be found [here](http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/edu-electrical.htm) from Innovation First.
yes.  one for each side of the robot.  they have output shafts on both sides, so that you don't have to reverse the motor direction on one side of the robot in order to make them run in the same direction like you usually do.  makes it run a lot straighter.

the extra output shafts on the trannies (the ones going towards the middle) power the winch.  it should lift a little over (i think, but don't quote me on this) 300 pounds? in high gear.  that would be 600 in low gear.  it goes quite fast, raises at 30 inches/second.

you can't see the shifter, but its there.  high gear is 14.5 feet/sec, low gear is 8.5 feet/sec

edit: check out the rest of the bot [here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=25684)
I dont have any C code for dead rec, but I can psudeo code for you and you can map it into C

if autonmode = false then  /* initialize the auton variables*/
begin
sequence = 0
autontime = 0
end

else  /* do the auton stuff */
begin

autontime = autontime+1  /* increment the loop counter */

if sequence = 0 then
begin
motor pwms = 254  /*full speed, or whatever you want for the 1st step*/
if autontime = 40 then  /* this step happens for 40 loops */
begin
sequence = sequence + 1 /* next sequence next time */
autontime = 0                 /*zero the loop count */
end
endif
else

if sequence = 1 then    /*the next step*/
begin
right motor pwm = 0  /* turn hard right */
left motor pwm = 254
if autontime = 10 then  /* this step happens for 10 loops */
begin
sequence = sequence + 1 /* next sequence next time */
autontime = 0                 /*zero the loop count */
end
endif

else
if sequence = 2 then  /* ect ect ect */

......

get the idea? have a variable that tells you which step of your sequence you are in, and have a variable that tells you how many times you have gone through the loop, and end that step when you have repeated it for a certain number of loops

this is dead rec - you have no outside info telling you how fast you are actually moving, how far you have turned - you have to use trial and error to test this with your bot and tweak the motor pwm settings for each sequence step, and tweak the autontime equality 'if' for each step, to get the bot to more or less go where you want it to go.

also, within each step you can turn other motors, or relays on and off, depending on what you want your machine to do at each step.

make any sense?
here's a hint - don't turn.  just go in a straight line.  the wall is your friend.

edit (I am completely serious)


Oh, so you can't use the radio modems for misc comm stuff? We have last year's, too. I was hoping we could use those for something else...



You shouldn't try to use the radio modems that came in the kit of parts with anything else.  They are not RS232 compatible (they use RS422 instead).  Innovation First used to sell a similar set of radio modems called "Stampers" I believe which could be used for wireless download & debugging of the older BASIC Stamp-based controllers.
I must say, this is a teaser that is probably going to have a lot of people guessing onto it's function. It does look like a linear motion gear drive, possibly for an elevator or opening/closing arms? I'd really like to know, I'm very intrigued by this teaser! :D
Stef,
We will be attending the Great Lakes Regional, Northwest Regional, and Nationals.  None of the same as the wonderful RoboDevils =\  But, maybe sometime before the first regional, you guys could come visit.  Actually, Purdue's Spring Break starts March 12, so we'll be home for the entire next week.  We'll try to set some time to visit one weekend night when you guys will be packing, planning, and prepairing for regionals.
My cough seemed to get better soon after the season was over...weird! lol
Do you remember this: "Hey look, there are the TecnoKats!  Wait...that's not them!!" ?

my guess is something that "telescopes" up and then allows the robot to hang from the bar.


I'm glad you guys like it :) Once I finish the animation within the next few days, I'll put a link in here with a 1600 x 1200 resolution and a 1024 x 768.  :]



Not to ask you for too much, but could you maybe do 800 x 600 for those of us with lousy monitors?   :)
I like the model, but perhaps some hand-done smoothing groups are in order? The current groups make the normals looks bad, and while that may look fine once textured, its not a good habit to get into.


So, as we've been dealing with lowering our robot's weight considerably, we're investigating alternative methods of sheating our robots and its internal components from damage.

One method we're pursuing is the use of fabric rather than the traditional sorts of lexan covers many robots have.  So, I've been wondering what sort of fabric teams used last season on their wings -- as seen on robots from teams like 60, 118, and 343.

We need something that's light, strong, readily available and, with luck, puncture and tear resistant.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks.




I hear spider silk is strong for it's weight  :yikes:


But seriously what are you covering? Sub systems that extend outside the plane of your robot or just the main systems? We've found that just sturdy supports strategically spaced can protect the robot from balls and the like, if you're worried about arms and what not getting inside and entangled lexan really is the best to use. Very thin lexan is light and still very strong, if you don't have it over a wide area and have some kind of support behind it you could get away with stuff that's an 1/8 thick or even less. The weight is pretty nominal
Heh.  If anyone cares, my unfinished projects are: http://www.de-faced.com/old/design/ http://www.de-faced.com/old/design2/ and http://www.de-faced.com/old/design3/

They're just messed up designs that I never got around to finishing.  That first one was for a client, but they never contacted me again.. Oh well.
1/16" Lexan can be pretty darn brittle, though it still might be stronger than any fabric you can find.  The best option I could think of would be some kevlar fabric.  Here's one source, I'm sure you could shop around for someothers:

[Kevlar](http://www.carb.com/catalog/fabric/kevlar100/pages/K5504-38X.html)

Edit:
Just saw something in another thread that could be a good idea.  Why not use mesh, like for window screens or something slightly thicker?  Search MSC for "wire cloth"
Heres a tip if your having problems staying on the line, make it go in reverse if no line is being read.  Heres a picture of the temp configuration (gonna have a metal plate for final all neatly up under the hood. and holes in chasse for beam to get out.)) and a video of this year's sensors on last year's bot.

Thanks again for all your help again I defintatly have a better understanding know than when I originally posted  this but could somebody  have something in C code cause I am still not exactly sure how to write it, I now know what to say (before I wasn't all to sure.) Thanks all again for your help I'll definatyl remeber you guys for what you have done


P.S. Solace exactly how do you set it up to not turn in the style of this game?


A procedural material is a high definition material that uses multiple layers of maps, including bump, diffuse, mask, composite, blend, reflections, and much more. There's nothing else that it can be really.




I dont know where you got that definition from. I was assuming you were referring to material that heavily uses procedural maps - maps generated in render time by the software. This is the standard definition as far as i know.

I guess looking back on the thread you thought that i was suggesting "baking" the bump, reflection, etc onto the diffuse texture, but that is not at all what i was talking about. I was talking about rendering the procedural maps (like fractal noise, marble texture, etc.) into a bitmap, so that software doesnt have to recalculate it all the time. This also works for multiple layers of maps (in most cases), so that software doesnt have to blend between 10 different stacked bitmaps all the time, but blends them once and stores the result, and then uses it during rendertime.

does anybody know what the small ball size restrictions are??




From page 3 of the latest team update(#12):
"balls will be inflated at each site to their stated 13" dimension measured at their Equator(the manufacturing seam of the ball). Since misshapen balls are expected, they are considered to be part of the game challenge."

Our site is almost completed. You can check it out here: http://robotics.jhs.net. Thanks.
I think he's talking about 3D Studio Max (looking at the title..). If you have the animation button selected, it automatically makes each individual piece rotate on it's own individual axis.  You have a few options.  If you just want the entire piece to rotate as one and move together, then make sure all your pieces are selected and click Group(on the top toolbar) -&gt; group.  Now all your pieces will be as one.  If you have a complex piece, you're going to have to link your pieces to one piece so it will follow the path and rotation of the main piece, but will be able to rotate/move freely.  To do this, select all your parts BUT the "main piece" (which can be anything) and click the select and link button.  A bunch of lines should be coming out from all the selected parts, now click and drag them to the one unselected piece that you have.  Now all your parts should follow that one unselected piece.

Hopefully that helped some, if you're confused on any part of this just ask.  :]
Thanks for the reply.  I actually figured out the group option soon after I posted this thread.  I have a new problem now, though.  I need to access some parts of the group individually afterward, but if I select ungroup, it the keys that I set for the group disappear.  What can I do to fix this?

Who else is submitting their chairman's award submission to the Silicon Valley Regional?

Team 254 is.  We look forward to competing with you (and hopefully winning - I put way too many hours into this already).



Matt,
Maybe it's the fault of text not adequately conveying the intended tone or emotion of your words, but I think that what's inside those parentheses is a little rude.  It's okay to ask who else is submitting, and it's okay to wish others luck, but for a team applying for the Chairman's Award to say that they hope they win because they've put time into their submission is a little off base.  Everyone who writes a submission puts a lot of time and effort into it, and all but one entry doesn't win the award.  It's hard work, and it's usually a thankless job for those who slave over their entries.  For a lot of deserving teams they end up with just their entry for documentation's sake.


The following isn't intended to be directed towards you, Matt or towards your team (it just happens that my reply triggered this train of thought), but at everyone who reads these forums and has aspirations for some sort of Sportsmanship Award or Chairman's Award.  This is just something that has irked me from time to time...  Chairman's Award judges and other judges may not read these forums, but almost half the teams in FIRST do.  Those of us who read these forums inside and out can identify the teams who win the awards because they display a hollow shell of empathy, assistance, and sportsmanship and we can identify the teams who are actually helpful and outwardly compassionate towards all other teams because they want to improve the quality of as many teams as possible.  In fact, many times the more deserving teams aren't rewarded with awards because they feel as though their acts of generosity and sportsmanship are not above the call of duty, but they are just necessary deeds.  These teams are rewarded with experiences that are worth thousands of times more than awards.  In my opinion awards like the Chairman's Award shouldn't be thought of as awards that you "compete" for.  The awards should be secondary to the pleasure your team gets by doing the  FIRST community, and your own community a needed service that (hopefully) changes people's lives for the better.
TYVEK is a trade name for a building housewrap. I believe it is made of spun olefin fiber and is extremely tear resistant. I am thinking of using it or a similar product to cover our bot. The drawback would be the tradenames that appear all over the product.
Make sure that you have the "Include Path" under **Project--&gt;Build Options...--&gt;Project** equal to "C:\mcc18\h". The default location is "C:\mcc18\" but if you installed the C complier somewhere else, change it to point to that location. While you're in the dialog box make sure the "Library Path" equals "C:\mcc18\lib" (or the equivalent if you installed in a different location).
I know freshmen make easy targets and it's all in good fun but remeber they are the future of your team and if all they remember is how badly they were treated and they don't come back it's the team that will ultimately suffer.
Very nice.

reminds me of ours.  I personally took a great part in their manufacture.  I am very proud.  Ours are doubled up but ofset so they run real smooth.  But to keep the weight down we had to cut the inard aluminuim down.  We overdid it.  We were testing the robot without our bumper, hit a the stairs and *bend* !!!   :ahh: They were easy to fix. :p

Man i love those wheels.

to see them go to www.robomo.com/FIRST

there is no finished photo but u get the idea.
Don't use Tyvek! Don't use it! Please!

Sorry. We have two gigantic rolls of plain Tyvek that we're always tempted to use, but never do; it is extremely tear resistant, yes, but it's puncture resistance is terrible. I was able to poke through it with my finger.

We're doing the same thing, M, because our robot's shape isn't very lexan-friendly with all sorts of weird angles. We're using truck bedding tarp; you know, the waterproof stuff made to put over truck beds when it rains? It's light as a feather, and you can't get through it with a pin. It's pretty cool :)
Does NASA stand for Not Always Scientifically Accurate?


Beat this ladies and Gentlmen .. As of last night .. Kilabyte weighs in at 145lbs :ahh: .. I dont even think Dr. Atkins can help.. It is time for some serious plastic surgury....


Sounds like you need to scrap a mechanism.  Either that or do a serious remanufacturing of all the parts out of a thiner material.  We are only 3.5 pounds over and we are still remanufacturing a major part.
Sorry Bill.  That was not my intent at all.  I too am one of the people who says doing the service, helping out, etc. is what matters not winning the award itself.  I've been exhausted working on the submission (working about 12 hours a day on it for the last week.  I realize that the presentation/submission is not why teams should (or do) win.  Last year, we had a horrible submission (a plain word document with only text) and our video did not work when we tried to play it.  I also did not mean that we are going to necessarily "compete" with other teams for the award.  I should have said that I look forward to seeing what other teams have done to spread the message of FIRST.  Please forgive my quick words.
This is a hot-button subject on these forums as there are many, many answers to how much mentor involvement is too much.

According to FIRST, any amount of mentor help is appropriate from none to building the entire robot.  The only important thing is that the students on the team become inspired by the process.  Thus the meaning of the acronym.  So from a technical standpoint, having an entirely mentor built robot isn't necessarily a bad thing.

The important thing is that the kids on the other team are getting interested in engineering and sciences and such.  You should talk with the kids on the other team.  If they're sulking about, annoyed that they didn't get to do anything on the other robot then there's a problem.  If they're at a competition and they're only near the robot to drive it and they're complaining that they never get to do anything with the robot then there's a problem.

On the other hand, if they're excited about their robot and such, then it's probably ok.  I, personally, don't think a mentor built robot is a good idea, but it could be right for some teams, it just depends.

On the whole, it's something for that team to work out for themselves.  You can give advice and ask them if they really like having a mentor built robot or if they'd rather work on it some themselves, but the team needs to decide that for itself.
Unfortunatly everything you mentioned is the only requirements for the storry board.


i would love to hear this  :D




O.K. here is what I am thinking.  The ultimate doomsday scenario.  A certain team...lets call them team number....25.....starts off straddling the line.  In a matter of 3 seconds, they manage to slide underneath the ball troft and unfold this rather large sail/ramp.  The balls fall from the troft and land in sed ramp, then funnel down into the human player station for a plentiful supply to the human player.  After all the balls have been exhausted from the ramp, they fold back up and hang.

It would take one heck of an engineering feat to accomplish this, and there are only a few teams which I can picture doing something this crazy and making it work...team 25 being one of them.

Good Luck!

:edit: I see it is a drill and a globe sorry bout that
How can you ask that?


Team 852's site, http://www.athenianrobotics.org, is up. Please let me know what you think of it.

Known Bugs: The photo gallery alignment is sometimes off. The positioning is majorly buggered in IE5/Mac. Otherwise, let me know!




I really enjoyed your site because it's full of stories, which I really wish our teams site had much more of.  Everything seems to be okay in IE & Mozilla.  Great job, especially on the content.
Definitely a bit creepy, but I'm not all that worried - I'm sure that everyone will be fine in Atlanta.  The fact that we're (usually) in large groups helps, and it's not like the city's police department will be on vacation while FIRST is down there.

Then again, 818 hasn't made it to Atlanta yet...
In 2002 we worked until 7 AM before the scrimmage and then went, played once and fatally broke the drive system.  In 2003, we worked until 2AM before the scrimmage, then went, played two good matches, won one, lost the other, then went back to school because we had to tear down the whole robot for lightening and replacing a bunch of parts.

This year, we are at Beach Cities right now (Friday Night), we will be tearing down the robot tomorrow morning to lighten, once lightened (by lunch), we will reassemble (after lunch), add finishing touches, and do a little programming testing.  Once we get some code that works (around 4:30 hopefully), we will spend about an hour buffing and polishing all the aluminum to a mirror finish.  We already spent four hours buffing and polishing previously on the frame so it should be quick for the rest of the stuff.  We might not do a full four step (mirror finish) polish on the arm since it has so much surface area and the aluminum is pretty dark.  We'll probably at least brighten it up though.

Anyway, then we will have dinner from 5:30-6:30 with our sponsors and parents and mentors and everyone.  Then we will clean up, and leave at 7PM.

This is our pre-scrimmage plan, who knows if it will work.  I sure hope the guys down at Beach cities tonight don't break my drivetrain (or any other part for that matter)

After the scrimmage, we will make our cost list, shipping crate, and robot cart.  Then if we have time, we will make the robot look even cooler with a special colored substance.


I was wondering who will be submitting for the Chairman's Award at the Pacific Northwest Regional this year?

we (team 847) will be this year.




I believe our team (1056) is, not sure though.
I want everyone on CD who is going to come look for me.  Ask anyone with 696 if Dave is around, that's me.  I will be wearing a FIRST-SME card/leash with lots of buttons.
[sQuide.com](http://www.squide.com)
My page for pretty much just for all the sites I've designed and/or am hosting (like our Robotics page).


I don't have time to work on a personal homepage... so you may or may not find me @ www.yan-wang.com :)



:D KOOL!
Yay, Greek gods!  You are correct.
I think what solace is saying is, if you point your bot so it grazes the side barrier, then (depending on how your bot is powered, the type of drivetrain you have) the side rails will deflect it and it will skid along the railing, and be forced to go straight along the edge.

Im not sure how well that will work for all bots - if you have two wheel drive and castors or skids on the back, it might work

or your wheels might hit the side railing and stall, causing the bot to turn towards the railing, ending up square into it and going nowhere?

I dont know C programming well enough to translate what I wrote above into something that will compile, and even if I did, I would have to be there with you to test it on your bot and help you tweak it.

If you are going to have an auton mode, you are going to have to understand C a little bit - try looking over one or two control statement - like the IF statement - if you can get a good handle on how to use IF statements, you should be able to write the sequence algorythm somewhat like I explained it.

give it a shot - and something else - you cant always try your code with the wheels up off the ground, and see it its sorta doing what its suppose to, before you let the robot run by itself on the floor :c)

BTW - there are excellent resources on both the www.usfirst.org website for a tutorial on C, and the default code users guide in the document section of www.innovationfirst.com site.


When you come home after working 12 hours on your robot and go straight on Chief Delphi.




When you come home after working endlessly on the bot.. and yet still find time to read every post in this thread!!!!   :rolleyes:
Im not sure a quarter second is fine enough resolution for doing dead recogning code - when you are turning a quarter second is a long time

its very easy to have a variable that you increment everytime you loop through your auton code, and use that as a rough timer - if it increments in the main loop it will have a 26mS period - If you increment it in the user_fast code it will be even smaller (I forget the period off the top of my head)

and you dont have to mess with interrupts that way.
see when i read your post it popped  into my head i wrote a counter and threw in some arbitrary numbers im just waiting to test it now, but thanks for the help, heres what i wrote.

Well, remember I don't know what I'm doing. hehehehe
It seems simple enough, and seems to work.

But you also dont have to put ur drive motors at full (255 or 0 depending on direction) for that quarter of a second.

It's all about tweaking.   :D

-Nick
Where did you get the manifold for the solonoids?
We are using four double solonoids and they are all connected by individual hoses. A manifild would be much simpler and more space efficient.

Looks incriediable!

Good luck!

-Andy


having them look for nonexistant parts is also fun ie: a metric cresent wrench
but seriously we need them if we want this organization to continue




or a wire stretcher :)

really though, our freshmen have been a tremendous help this year!


We need help with code in autonomous.   We want our robot to turn (left or right) stop and then actuate a relay and move a speed controller motor.  We need to know how to make the code and where to put it in the default code.

Thanks     team 634




Look in the file user_routines_fast.c and look for User_Autonomous_Code().  You will put your code here.  I suggest implementing a simple state machine, e.g.:



switch (auton_state) {
case TURN:
{
// put code to turn in desired direction here
// change state when you are done turning
// you'll know this either by a pre-determined time,
// a gyro reading/accumulation, or an encoder system
break;
}
case ACTUATE:
{
// put code here to actuate the relay/move motor
break;
}
...
default:
{ // either you have a default condition, or this should print an error
}
}



You can add as many states as suits your pleasure -- this makes it easy to change how you do the auton mode quickly.  Make sure you change the state to the next one once you are done with the current.  A little more details/more info on what you want/your robot would help to elicit a more specific response ... but this should get you started.
in general, when new students join a FIRST team, they have to be shown how to do many different things, from writing C code, to crimping wires, to soldering, to using a drill press...

so for a rookie team, none of the students will have any hands on experience with building FIRST robots.

Its always been our teams goal to show the students how the different tasks are down, then let them try it and after a few weeks they are able to take that part of the design over completely.

For a rookie team, I would not be surprized if the mentors ended up building at least half the bot before everyone was up to speed. And something to keep in mind - very often rookie teams dont quite understand what FIRST is all about - they dont 'get it' until they have been to a regional, seen the interaction between teams on the field and in the pits, seen all the students working on the machines between matches

So rookie teams can have a wide range of mentor/student work done on the machine, but dont worry - once the students see what other teams are doing, and they gain confidence in themselves, they wont sit idley by next year and let the mentors do all the work. :^)
I dont think you want to use any of the sleep modes - there is code that has to run for the RC to function correctly - the code runs in one continious loop - if you put the uP to sleep, it will stop till an interrupt occurs - I think it would cause the RC to lock up or reset on you.

Sleep modes are normally for low power applications, like PDAs or cell phone - your bot will be drawing 50 to 100 amps during a match, so whats 0.1 Amps more or less going to accomplish?
what about a pause function? Same results?
Dear Concerned FIRST Participant,

Your concerns have echoed those of many of us over the years. FIRST has a reputaion of being a "High school robotics contest", and that can lead to come concerns about engineer involvement. "High school students could never have built that," the naysayers say, and the rub is, they're right. The average high school student knows, if anything, very little about mechanical, electrical, and software design and farication. And it's not the goal of the FIRST program to teach them. As the wise old man of these forums* has said, it's not our job as engineer mentors to teach high school students engineering in six weeks. How could we? It has taken years for we engineers to be able to do what we do.

So what is FIRST all about? As has been pointed out time and time again, the key letter in the acronym is the second - Inspiration. It is our job as engineer mentors to make student want to pursue a career in a scientific or engineering field. That's it. The teams you see with really cool robots, like the one you described, have really cool robots because a really cool robot is more inspiring than one that you spend six weeks building with your buddies only to find out, when it's all over, it doesn't turn.

Put the question like this - would you be more likely to want to be an engineer when you grow up if you helped a team of engineers spend six weeks building an incredible robot, or if you spent six frustrating weeks banging your head against what turned out to be a pretty simple problem?

*Dr. Joe - sorry, after a search I haven't been able to find the post.
if you want to use the HW timers thats great - my only point is you might want finer resolution on the interval period

remember that there will be a bot coming towards the center of the field from the other direction - you should try to get their first, so it doesnt get in your way and prevent you from reaching your release ball

and if you are running your motors at low speeds and something is in your path, you wont have any chance of pushing it out of your way
All great points.
Something I'll def. try to keep in mind when I'm trying to code it on monday!
same problem, you have to let the main loop run, or the code that is buried in the RC (that we dont see) will say "hey, the user code stopped running, turn off all the victors and relays until it comes back"

( of course it says that in binary: 00011000101010101101101   :c)


Definitely a bit creepy, but I'm not all that worried - I'm sure that everyone will be fine in Atlanta.  The fact that we're (usually) in large groups helps, and it's not like the city's police department will be on vacation while FIRST is down there.

Then again, 818 hasn't made it to Atlanta yet...




Actually I've been to Hotlanta a few times (I have brothers and a sister who live down there) and I was more concerned about the traffic than I was about crime but like any large city there are a few rough spots. I think teams should be a bit more mindful of their kids possibly wandering off, that's for sure.
Mostly I'm just put off that the police department would doctor numbers so they can attract events. Not very professional.
Basically it's not judged, you just have to have one.  I make rectangles on word.  We printed our rectangles on MS Word and drew our scenes on it.

Remember, you CAN upload your storyboards to streamline w/ the final animation.  :]
11 cylinders!?!?!  I can guess what 6 or 7 of them are for but that's about it.  I cannot possibly wait another 38 hours to see this thing.  But I guess I will have to.  You are going to Chatsworth right?
ah, speaking of hotlanta, any idea what the temperature would be down there during the middle of april? ;)

i was initially a bit concerned about the crime rate, but considering its a big city, like koko ed said, every city has a bit of roughness to it. its nice to wish that everywhere we went we could be safe and secure but it aint gonna happen.

&lt;/almost mugged getting off bus around 930 after build session&gt;

you got the right idea, but you cant use the for loop- the uP will execute that code all at once, and only output the pwm values once

the entire code runs in one big loop

A. first the operator interface commands are read in (a serial input stream)

B. then the block of user code runs once (including your custom auton code)

C. then the pwm commands are sent out to the motors and relay spikes

D. goto A

this loop runs as long as the robot is on - and it takes about 26mS each time through

thats why I had that variable auton_time incrementing at the start of the auton code - everytime the loop runs that count goes up by 1, and you know another 26mS of your life has gone by.

so if I look for auton_time to be = 10, that means 260mS have gone by - about a quarter of a second. If I look for it to be 40, thats about a second.

so if you put a 'for' statement up there between B and C, it will sit and spin on itself very quickly, maybe 100 uS, and then go on like it wasnt even there.
Last year all animation judging was done on Friday, so my guess would be probably not.

Rochester was in the crosshairs for it's crime rate from a Toronto writer who wrote some seriously nasty things about our little town when we were trying to get tourism from Toronto with the fast ferry comming to town.
If you look hard enough any city will have warts, I suppose.


P.s. The fast ferry would be a great way for the Canadian teams to get to the Rochester regional next year. ;)
I can't see the whole thing (obviously because its a teaser) but it looks very well done.  I haven't ever seen a team use a rack gear before and I compliment you for doing so.  Whatever it does, I think it is great.
then does anyone  know how i could begin a counting steps or loops in the code ? I really  only know C from when i did a litle cgi, i have never used it in this application before.
That is really cool.  We will be making something almost exactly like that tomorrow.  I've used a torch before to bend it, one of our mentors says to use a hot metal bar. What kind of a heatgun did you use?  Did it discolor or bubble at all?
I was just informed it will be sleep(1); will that 1 millisecond make a difference and cause those problems?
The solenoid manifold is available through SMC.  We purchased ours through motion industries.

11 pistons... I will try to break it down in a fairly subtle manner.  2 for wings, 2 for center lift, 2 for rear lift, 2 for shifting ;), 1 for ball grabber, 2 for elev release.

That should hold you off until sunday.  We might not be fully functional as we just realized that our reduction for the arm is not sufficient... so we are trying to throw together a quick solution before sunday.  See you then.
I went back to my finished scene with the storyboard and applied toon materials too my scene :)
I just expressed mailed out the storyboards today ($17  :ahh: ). Put our titleboard on the cover of the folder. Hopefully that will be sufficent.
we have the banner sensors hooked up so that every time the drill motor turns 1 revolution it clicks twice. both wheels have one. that way we can not only accuratly turn, but also compensate for errors in slipage as we know how many clicks SHOULD be per x loops and how many ARE per x loops. it works very well and i wrote easy_left_turn(time), easy_right_turn(time), hard_left_turn(time), hard_right_turn(time), drive_slow(time), drive_fast(time) functions that all have automatic slipage comensation. if i can get the code on a floppy ill be glad to post it. so far its worked perfectly


I really enjoyed your site because it's full of stories, which I really wish our teams site had much more of.  Everything seems to be okay in IE & Mozilla.  Great job, especially on the content.




Ditto. Not  the flashiest site out there, but v. solid .

--Petey


Not to ask you for too much, but could you maybe do 800 x 600 for those of us with lousy monitors?   :)




Can do.  Anyone else who has monitor size requests, just ask... but try to make them somewhat standard :)




please help!!! i just loaded the program and can't figure out why it would give
me an error because i haven't even messed with it...yet





The path to the source code cannot be longer that 64 characters. Try moving it closer to C:\


11 pistons... I will try to break it down in a fairly subtle manner.  2 for wings, 2 for center lift, 2 for rear lift, 2 for shifting ;), 1 for ball grabber, 2 for elev release.


Wings?!?  You must be FLYING up to the bar. :D   I have a fairly good idea of what the wings and shifters are, I think the rear lift either helps you turn or helps you get up the stair or lifts up the robot then sets it on the lip of the goal or mayeb a combination of these things.  The center lift must lift the robot off the ground.  I kind of figured one will be for a ball grabber.  But I have no idea what the 2 pistons labled "elev relaease" are.  Perhaps they bring an arm up to the height of the bar.  I really want to see this thing sitting on the scale.  With 10 20P gears (I assume) and 11 cylinders, and of course sprockets and chains for driving and linking for 4wd, and all the stuff actuated by these cylinders, I really don't know how you guys do it.  I see couple "future Andy Bakers" here on these boards, guess who one of them is.  ;)

Perhaps you are only shifting either only the drills or only the chias, but I have a feeling it will be both.  Perhaps there will be no other motors than the ones driving, that I see as being possible.  But how will you have enough air for 11 cylinders?  I know two are small for the shifters but still, 9 cylinders?  We don't even have as much air as we'd like for our 1 cylinder.

EDIT: I hope you and I will meet up at Chatsworth and have a long discussion about your marvel of a machine.
I modified the storyboard template from this link:
http://wwwnew.towson.edu/ciat/resources/videoresources.htm

It's in Word format and just uses separate frames for pictures and text,
so you can resize them to fit your needs.
You can scan drawings or whatever, save them as something
small like a jpeg and use "insert file" in Word to bring them in.

> can mentors help too much. In a team close to mine I have seen a robot that many people from many surrounding teams suspect is "mentor fabricated" and bolted together and wired by students.


2001 our robot was student built - our national champion. Since then lots of mentors on the team. This is the first year I've been there hour after hour witnessing students welding/machining independently, then the mentors teaching machining/welding to less talented students, the students working on pneumatics by themselves...however our control board gets little student input. Last year a student worked for awhile with the mentor, this year a couple of students did some soldering.

I remember that story about the rookie team arriving at a regional with a box of parts and 3 veteran teams building a robot for them in 6 hours.

What's too much? *rhetorical* Do what your team wants to do, let others do what they want to do, and luck and talent enter into who's going to win a competition, but everyone wins by the process involved in the experience.
about a week ago our robot (1023) weighted in at about 160. As of tonight we are at 128.4 with just hooks for the moblie goal and sensors to put on.
We just finished rendering, 1st attempt... at 100% , no compressing, which gave us a file size of nearly 700,000 KB  :ahh:  :ahh: however, our 2nd time we compressed at 75% with Cinepak, which reduced file size to rougly 120,000 KB.  I would suggest doing this if you're having trouble, because we have live video too, which added a lot of file size to the entire thing.

/stops sweating bullets  :]
ours alternated both with tether and radio.
is that bad?

and how do you attach the lights?
i only see one hole on the back. and no bolts in the kit are the correct size..
can i just drill small holes on the corners to let bolts through?


about a week ago our robot (1023) weighted in at about 160. As of tonight we are at 128.4 with just hooks for the moblie goal and sensors to put on.


Care to explain how you reduced it so much?  I'm sure we all would love to hear.
no, it is a drill and a Fischer-price
I'm impressed with the transmission.  I'm just wondering how you know the plastic gears will handle the job.  Because' I'm all for the weight savings if they are strong enough.
they work because the plastic gears are only used for the gears right out of the motors.  very low torque at that point, they should be fine.
I wouldn't worry about it ours blink both as well.
i never saw a resolution that wasnt standard....

i'll take one for 1024*768

Thnx
Here's my suggestion.  use a relatively long piece of aluminum with a piece of teflon on the bottom and just use one piston in the middle of the robot.  I think it'll work better.  You won't have to worry about getting two casters parallel.  You don't have to worry about the casters coming down facing the wrong direction.  I think it'll be easier over all.
I hope everyone submits an application its a good learning experience. We won the award last year and we just finished our award submission last night. So hope alot of you Pacfic Northwest Regional goers submitted your Chairman's Award because its always fun to have competition. See you there

Nate
I'm a freshman and I am the only one on my team that knows 3ds max.
(Actually, someone else does but he is the CAD lead; I'm left to do our animation). Oh exciting deadlines.
Well hope that disproves some generalizations.  :p
My team doesn't treat members by grade. We're all treated equally no matter what our skill levels are. :)
First year members can learn what second year member knows very quickly. So they don't have any specific "simple" jobs...
never say never -  in 2002 we were able to successfully bring our robot down from 160 something pounds to within weight without sacrificing functionality.

this year we're better off, we weigh in at only 147 pounds.
today we finally check we all thought it was going to be heavy cuz of the looks but it came in at 97 lbs and it its no small robot
Awww... but I need the FIRST logo in 2D Cad.. prefferably a .dwg or .dxf file...

Nice looking image though, none-the-less!
With the robot fully assembled she weighed about 125...Probably a little more, but she'll make the weight limit for sure.
I have a suggestion that comes from personal experience.  "allthread and nut spacers" have a rearkable tendency to work themselves loose over time.  I would recommend that you consider removing the middle nuts, adding a real spacer over the threaded rod, and replacing the outer nuts with nylock nuts, or at the very least drenching the thing in loc-tite.

By the way - let Eric know I'm eternally greatfull for his dad fixing the TIG welder.  It became my favourite tool this season  :)
Looking forward to meeting you guys in March.  And best luck to you guys and your team!

*tear*

it's just...so...beautiful...
Sounds pretty sweet.
good luck to getting enough weight off.  I think even with swiss cheesing it will be a stretch for 17 lbs....!   Hope you get something figured out.
PLease tell me that in the boxes marked "Lav Guard" and "Lav Shield" there are not those little blue deodorant cakes that go in urinals....  :eek:


Beat this ladies and Gentlmen .. As of last night .. Kilabyte weighs in at 145lbs :ahh: ...




Ok, I will. As of first weigh in 2 nights ago we were at 149.9lbs......needless to say our robot was put on a serious crash diet.
As of last night we were down to 131, looking foward to tommorows weigh in to see were we are at.
:cool:


its very easy to have a variable that you increment everytime you loop through your auton code, and use that as a rough timer - if it increments in the main loop it will have a 26mS period



I'm doing something even simpler -- I'm simply zeroing a specific variable every time through the 26ms loop.  The fast loop code just checks to see when it becomes zero, and maintains its own timers.

> If you increment it in the user_fast code it will be even smaller (I forget the period off the top of my head)

Doesn't **user_fast** just go "as fast as possible"?  The period will just depend on how much time it takes to execute the function.

>  and you dont have to mess with interrupts that way.

Messing with interrupts is, um, *messy*. :)
What is LOTR, Lord of the RINgs
Oh wow, I have seen the entire robot in pictures and wow haha it JUST looks amazing;) haha its the combinations of many good robots in the past. Travis i hope that didnt reveal THAT much:-p
I still crack up every time I think about those poor people in the van.   :D
Glad to hear that the welders are providing entertainment.
I saw the pics of the bot tonight...man that thing is beutiful...almost makes me wanna cry. :)  Too bad I have to wait till IRI to see it in action.
Eric
Why do you need multiple castors?  Just use one, and have a small cylinder pop it up and down.  The cylinder could have less that an inch of travel, and therefore would be small, compact and lightweight.  We were going to do this if our omni's fell though.

I am sure you can three wheel it for the turns.  Plus, it should be down for long if you program it to pop down only when you turn past a certian angle.
*plays the clip about ten times*

*wonders if Blondie can drag people, too*

We'd never do anything to make her mad, though. Just don't introduce her to your ED-5...Don't want her getting any ideas now... :p
Yes, it does work well. we have it now that the arm works a heck of a lot faster now. it used to take around 15 seconds to raise the arm and "flip" the wrist. now it is down to about 4-6 seconds .
96 will definatly be there, but whether our robot will be working or not is a different matter (stupid programming. I'd have our programmer shot if he wasn't me)

1027 (west springfield) is also a little behind in the working robot situation, but I think they'll be there (we share a playing field, and some other resources, so we are in constant communication. I'm talking speed-dial here).

Well, I can't wait to see you all there!!!!!!



and how do you attach the lights?
i only see one hole on the back. and no bolts in the kit are the correct size..
can i just drill small holes on the corners to let bolts through?




If you take the covers off the lights there are 2 spots about the size of button cell batteries, my team just drilled holes in each of these spots for a bolt to go throught and bolted them to mounts attached to the frame rails. It doesnt affect the light or its inner workings so FIRST shouldnt have a problem w/ it.


OH YEAH, its done so here is a quick one minute teaser of our robot! Its hosted on my server which only gets about 40k upload so don't overload it. (as in save it if you want to see it again)

Low quality(600k): http://stuypulse.no-ip.com/ftproot/Larry%20video%201%20low.wmv

Have fun watching.

I can host the 2.1 meg one for a week or so because your server takes a while and it is a good video.  Would that be okay with you?
What you could do(for autononmous) was have a start time and an end time to all things. Sort of like this:

//Autonomous code
go(1,0,18);   //Go forward (1 = fwd, 2 = rev), start at 0, and end at 1800ms
turn(1,19,25);  //Turn (1 = left, 2 = right), start at 1900ms end at 2500ms
//Notice the 1000ms delay!
moveArm(2,35,40); //Move arm ( 1 = up, 2 = down), start at 3500ms end at 4000ms


Of course, you'll need to use interrupts (use the white paper from Innovation First), and add a static counter to the t100msDelay, for increments of 100ms. More precision that using seconds. But, the way you should do it is it just sets a pwm (or whatever) equal to the correct value, and move on, when it comes back (you'll have to make it know that it already completed one and it's time to finish up) just set it to 127 or whatever. Very useful and very effective.
It would be greatly appreciated :)
It looks as though double sided 3M tape should do the trick, if that's an allowable fastener...
We used ruber bands that came with the kit.
Hey Andy, I may see you tommorrow depending on the weather.

A certain female acquaintance of ours &lt;cough&gt; JESS &lt;cough&gt; wants me to go and video tape some matches and see the general strategy..

Maybe I will see you there...
Well, i fixed a lot of crap, made it so it couldn't be randomly hijacked (thanks again deltacoder!) and added some more option to some more fields.

There are also a few more teams on it now, which I think it cool.

In other words, check it out.
Umm... yes, this weekend our team is at the local mall showing off and testing out our robot. we never know what is going to happen. we have had instinces where some of our "imature" team members have gone and done really stupid stuff. some of them have gone on little kiddie rides that they were probably 5 times too big for. others have used a speaker and mic to yell stupid stuff like "I wuv you" to people from behind walls.

p.s.- i'll try to get our webmaster to put a picture of the toilet on the website.
Procedural Textures are ones that are created mathematically at the time of rendering. While i may slow rendering down a bit it will not affect it by that much.  The pro about bitmaps is that they are more detailed when made correctly(ei not just a repeating pattern like procedurals) but unfortunately they will fill your hard drive fast if they are high quality and resolution.
I don't think the inspectors will like the use of that masking tape..


Hi,

I'm hoping someone from team 1446 will find this and private message me.  I'm a freshman at The George Washington University and an alumi of team 166.  Now I'm looking for a team in the DC-area that I could work with.

Please send me a private message over CD or find me on AIM (JPMcN).  I'd really like to talk.  Thanks!

That would make a grat commercial for FIRST...
our last years robot was 179 lbs. we got it down to 130.0lbs about 5 minutes before qualifications ended. This year's is 105lbs with a couple things not mounted
It reminds me of a praying mantice... o.0
Here ya go: www.team696.org/images/694vid.wmv

I'll leave it up for about a week or so and it should work without flaw for that time.


It looks like it's swerve / crab.   Gearbox clearly incorporates drill and CIM motors (maybe more).  There's a pneumatic cylinder going into or through the visible gearbox - perhaps a shift-on-the-fly design.  The radio modem will be relocated before competition.




CIA image analysts are not allowed to look at the teasers - it just spoils the fun for everyone else. Now go back to your spy satellite pictures and leave us to our robots.  :)
Hmm, we should probably clean the fingerprints off the lexan before UTC.
I've done a similar thing to the edges of my model train layout to protect the rolling stock in case of a derailment so it doesn't end up on the floor. I used 1/4" Lexan and heated it with a heat gun to match the contour of the edge of the layout. I have a variable temp (200-1200 degree) Milwaukee heat gun. I started at a lower heat and held it about 6" from the piece and slowly tried to bent it. I'm guessing I bent it around 350 degrees with the heat gun several inches from the Lexan. The amount you hold the heat gun over the piece will depend on the thickness of the material, the temp you're got it set at, and how far away you are from the piece. It's best to try it on a scrap piece first. Just remember some plastics are combustable.
we're real fast with lots of bells & whistles all under 130lbs with weight to spare.

We can hardly believe it ourselves.

For those of you &gt;130 - keep drill'n
Good Luck to all!  :)
I haven't read the white paper but I have found an excellent timer example at [www.kevin.org/frc](http://www.kevin.org/frc) it rocks! Interrupts aren't really that bad and you can get an incredible timer resolution from them. Right now our dead reckoning runs by tenth seconds but it could easily go by hundreth or milli-seconds.
We have a "machine" that has a strip like one in an oven the heats the lexan. We just lay it flat on it for about 15 sec, then bend and tah dah!
I'm guessing the gear rack is attached to a cylinder and when the cylinder is cycled the rack moves rotating the two gears which in turn rotate whatevers attached to them.
The picture says it all.  What a bunch of whackos we are.  :D<br><br>![IMG_0110.JPG|320x240](upload://wo4TdWln1H2ckLDDcnPT0ETfpua.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![IMG_0110.JPG|320x240](upload://wo4TdWln1H2ckLDDcnPT0ETfpua.jpeg.jpeg)<br>

What pictures are those?  ;)  Don't go spoiling toooooo many secrets now Akshay.

As for the motors, lets just say we only have 5 speed controllers.

Unfortunately, as pretty as it is, we are running into design flaw after design flaw with this thing.  The arm is becoming a problem, and the "elev...." hasn't risen yet.

With two sleepless nights we might just have it done and working for chatsworth.I will also guarantee that it won't tip over this time (let alone twicw!).
Every year just before xmas our team holds a "Lock-in" at a local place, actually a private residence that is rented out to people or groups for parties or such. It has a heated pool ( a must where we are located, it actually snowed at one of the lock-ins) in one room and another room is basically a "great room".  Well it seems every year we wind up getting into a flour, or in the case of last year, a talcum powder fight. Some people wound up covered along with the surrounding area. We do this around the pool so we can get the garden hose out afterward and wash the whole area down, and those covered would jump in the pool to clean off. Needless to say, some people wind up looking like the Pillsbury Dough Boy! :D


But it's a Matt tradition to frantically wire the robot the night before the scrimmage. ;)

I think we'll be done in time.  The only concern I have at the moment is getting the drive train installed and we should be doing that the next couple days (again, assuming are wheels actually arrive today).

Our issue isn't skilled people at the moment.  Our issue is just getting it done.  So we may need help with testing but I don't think we'll need it with assembly.

Matt




For us Southern Californians, let me clue you in.  Matt has, as much if not more, FIRST experience than any of us -- he's been involved in Maryland and New York and is now on a co-op here in LA and started helping a team within a few days of landing!  He's being very modest.  I suspect that it will not be us helping him on Sunday, but rather he will be helping all the rest of us!

Ken, hope to see you at Chatsworth!

Penny (better known on CD as Joe's mom and/or Greg's wife)
We used a 1300w heatgun. The board got a little tweaked from some areas getting hotter than others, but you cant tell it with out feeling the board. As for discoloring and bubbling, nah. The Lexan was 1/8" thick .. and took about 10 min to heat up the 34" strip of it. We had it clamped to the table with a 1x1 aluminum tube and some clamps on each side, and then one kid had a large 2x4 to bend the lexan.

Keep in mind, that lexan is flammable after 800 degrees (at least thats what the warning said on the plastic cover) So dont get it too hot .. and practice a few times on a spare piece, because it is a little tricky, and if you've never done it, you might wreck the expensive lexan.

Good luck.

(Edit)

Heres a picture of the setup we used to bend it ..

Team 634 Van Nuys High School will be there.  Without this event we would never stop trying to improve our robot.  This gives the students a long period of time to practice.  It gives us a temporal sense of completion for one day that amplifies our weakness and causes even more modifications.  This year we will try and build a second similar robot for the students to practice on after we send the first one in.  There never is enough practice time for the drivers!!!
Up by the PWM outputs, theres a little block of pins, that say "Team Color"

Plug em into there.
hmmmm, i believe thats would be my blood, sweat and tears in there. OK, maybe not tears but plenty of blood and sweat (Thank you Stef)


this weekend our team is at the local mall showing off and testing out our robot.




What a great idea! I've got to remember that!
Holy heck of a wiring job!! Man, if the rest of your robot is that neat, I hope you've got room on your trophy shelf for a Quality Award!! :)

Nice job!


Not all FIRST teams have schools that are supportive enough to warrant using their colors.



Bingo....
We worked out a lot of validation problems. Most of them were redundant errors contracted in the headers and footers scripts. The others were scattered through scripts.

How does it look/feel now?

I finally got the French translation system working properly. I had to create a completely different French version of the menu, then have it switch based on which language is selected. Makes it easy to update for future languages :-)
As far as I can tell, slightly adjusting all of the areas of alignment and replacing the battery has solved our problem. The drivetrain folks are coming back tomorrow evening, so I'm going to show them all of your replies and let them decide if it's fixed or not.

Our team will be at the Great Lakes regional, so I'll be sure and say thanks to you in person, Al.
Popdown casters are one of the best way to overcome the traction problems experienced when trying to turn doing skid steering.  The easiest way to do a caster is to put it near the front of your robot with the center of mass preferably between your back two wheels to aid in turning although this is not neccessary.  Casters take too long to turn and line up and continue allowing the robot to spin even after power is no longer applied.  The best way to go is delrin, or teflon either in the stick or furniture slide variety.  Be careful that your robot isnt going to be popping wheelies as ours is now :cool: .
-Aaron


Well said.

I think this is definitely a useful strategy, and will almost definitely occur. A solid defense is going to be key.





Completely agreed.  But in the event that a 2x ball is shoved down into a goal, it may take you longer to pull it out, and goaltending points could add up against you.  It will be interesting to see teams' approaches to all the different strategies and see which ones become popular...
The animation isn't the sole reason that I am doing FIRST, in fact I am disapointed that I wasn't able to do as much as I did last year for our team then this year cause of the animation.....Thats why I will probably work on it this summer, even if the criteira changes, I will still be using what I make for reels to show to colleges and stuff; thats also another reason why I want to win this award, it would be pretty impressive to put on a college resume....

BTW, does anyone know any good links on how to develop a really good short story? Or any books that are good?


I want everyone on CD who is going to come look for me. Ask anyone with 696 if Dave is around, that's me. I will be wearing a FIRST-SME card/leash with lots of buttons.


LOL, lazy, you should come looking for us. GGL, j/k.

We did an all nighter the night before. We were at the auto shop....well, i went home at like 2 am, i couldn't really help with the programming, but when everyone started to show up for to go the Chatsworth Scrimage people went to my house to take showers and stuff. I can't wait till tommorow's all nighter.

PS Sanddrag, y aren't you at our shop with your team? :p
Taken from Innovation First Full-Size RC Reference page 10:


> By default, these LED units will display red if you are using the default practice channel of 40. If you

Note that you cannot change the color yourself without a channel adapter connecting competition pin 12 to competition pin 8.
In Update 12, Rule G20, do I read this as they changed the scoring for goaltending so that now whoever commits goaltending gets -10pts each occurrence, instead of the other team getting the 10pts per goaltended ball?
just clarifying....


Our new tactic is to scare the opponents away with our utterly repulsive hawaiian shirt pattern for the '04 season.


I remember discussing this at IRI this past summer ... aren't they "Easter bunny puke" yellow and pink or something??

Hmmm... teams will run away from their controls at the mere sight of the shirts. Your robot doesn't even have to *do* anything - the other teams will get negative points for running away and you'll win with a high score of 0!

Great strategy! :p

> I'm pretty sure we'll be at the scrimmage. Whether or not I'll have slept the past two days is undetermined but I think we'll be there.


Hey Matt,

What is sleep and where can i get some?  It shouldn't be that hard to wire, so we probably will be there.  :yikes:


Why do you need multiple castors?  Just use one, and have a small cylinder pop it up and down.  The cylinder could have less that an inch of travel, and therefore would be small, compact and lightweight.  We were going to do this if our omni's fell though.

I am sure you can three wheel it for the turns.  Plus, it should be down for long if you program it to pop down only when you turn past a certian angle.




I agree with Ben on this one. In 2001 and 2003 we used a single popdown caster on our robot on the cylinder with 1" of travel. In both robots, the caster transferred most of the weight away from the back wheels, but not all. It allowed us to turn easily, yet maintain stability.
for those that actually have this working on the 2004 bot, what times are you getting to track the complete line?



PS Sanddrag, y aren't you at our shop with your team? :p


I really wish I could have been but I just couldn't today.  We'll have loads of fun at the scrimmage.  Don't you worry.  Oh, and sure, I'll come looking for you.  Afraid that I won't be found, I might try going to every pit (yours first of course) and introducing myself and offering my assistance wherever needed. :)
While you are asking permission for that, can you find out if there will be a Wi-Fi network available at UTC as well????

I doubt it, but maybe......????
Can I be on the "Safety" Crew of FART 2004???

Your team can hand out little "Doorknobs" as trophy's maybe?
Happy Belated Birthday to Evan from your pals on Team 237 from the great state of CT!!


Last year, our team made nametags instead, with little clip on the back. It wasn't really that expensive, especially if you go to one of those places online that make free nametags, laminate them, then attach clips to the back :D also, we had a few nametags with names of each person on the team, the engineers, and people who helped the group.



That is mandatory for us during the build season because of the policies at our HS....  Just more unwanted politics..  But the badges are cool!!!!

There are three teams in the District of Columbia (615, 928 and 1446).  The Banneker High School team (school web site: [http://benjaminbanneker.org/](http://benjaminbanneker.org/)) would be a great place to help.  They are very high on spirit, and short on engineering help.  I am sure they would love to have your participation.

There are also 10 teams in northern Virginia and four in the local Maryland area if you can't get linked up with any of the DC teams.

And yes, there is a hack to measure how much time people spend on the site. I'm not sure if I will be installing that or not.


Sounds like "Big Brother" is in fact Brandon Martus!!!  lol  ;-)




i think a good measurement would be how much time I'm **not** on the site


You weren't on the site Friday night around 5:30 - 6:00 now were you?? What's the matter?? Building a robot more important than conversing with fellow roboteers?? :p lol
I'm currently in counseling because of Chief Delphi. I'm not sleeping, I'm not eating, I'm not bathing, I just sit here day after day, minute after minute refreshing every second I can.

128.5 as of the other day before all our new spiffy speed holes we are having put in!!

Welcome to the big time!!



127lbs as of last night (2/20/04) after putting some more "stuff" on it, and making more spiffy patterns in the robot like [this one!](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=224832#post224832)

Still going to make the weight limit... SWEET!!!
When our grabber arms broke at Suffolk last year and they were flying around. I think the limit switch wiring was the only thing that held them on. We dragged them up the ramp, lucky they didn't turn us off for protruding through it. As I remember we mad it up on the ramp fine put down our suction cups and got the points.  :cool:
We have a winch built using the Tiagene Motor. We tested it out and our robot hangs almost completely level. It works WONDERFULLY. It has about a 500 lifting capacity, but CAUTION to other teams using this motor as a winch: Despite the fact that the motor utilizes a worm gear and lead screw and cannot be technically backdriven the drive shaft can and does slip inside of the worm gear. The shaft is not keyed and does slip causing the motor to backdrive. We are not using cable as most other team have discussed since it has to be stacked by a special sliding guide. Instead we are using winch strap which work better than cable. It has a 27,000LB. breaking load and stacks itself.
I have CD set to my homepage, which is cool, except I get distracted rather easily, and I only actually get around to checking my e-mail about half the time I go online.  This gets to be a problem on a campus where e-mail is the main form of communication.

This looks excellent, after sitting around looking out our programmers figure out nothing last night this is a breath of fresh air.  I personally am not a programmer, but I am going to try to implement this tonight after the Suffield Scrimmage.  We were using two sensors, and something didn't seem right about it, does anyone have any reccomendations, when using three sensor, on how to make the robot go backwards if its not seeing the line.  I have a very limited knowledge of C, and I feel our programmers are uncomfortable with the platform this year. so...

If you guys can help me make this work, there will be Krispy Kreme's at Hartford (or Atlanta) for you, on me.

Thanks a Bunch!

nah, those things are the little plastic pipe insulators that you see covering the pipes underneath sinks in public bathrooms.

Catastrophy might have a more advanced solution, but basically, if you don't see the the line with any of your sensors, reverse. Something like this:


if(rc_dig_01 == 0 && rc_dig_02 == 0 && rc_dig_03 == 0)
{
pwm01 = 0;
pwm02 = 0;
}



You would, of course, have to add the code for actually following the line, but that is basically all you have to do to reverse if you don't see anything on the sensors.

PS the digital inputs are your sensors and the pwmXXs are the drive motors.

PPS Nine banners. Crazy. :)


As it looks like FIRST could be lacking a large amount of spares at the regionals, I think it would be great if teams shipped their entire collection of motors along with their robots.




dont ship unused parts with your robot unless your team is flying - over a certain weight you will have to pay extra for shipping your container

bring your unused KOP with you on the bus - maybe some team can organize a Who-has-What data base of sorts so if you need a part, you will know who brought extras right away?


Look in the file user_routines_fast.c and look for User_Autonomous_Code().  You will put your code here.  I suggest implementing a simple state machine, e.g.:



switch (auton_state) {
case TURN:
{
// put code to turn in desired direction here
// change state when you are done turning
// you'll know this either by a pre-determined time,
// a gyro reading/accumulation, or an encoder system
break;
}
case ACTUATE:
{
// put code here to actuate the relay/move motor
break;
}
...
default:
{ // either you have a default condition, or this should print an error
}
}



You can add as many states as suits your pleasure -- this makes it easy to change how you do the auton mode quickly.  Make sure you change the state to the next one once you are done with the current.  A little more details/more info on what you want/your robot would help to elicit a more specific response ... but this should get you started.


Yeah, that is te basic idea. You would have a static variable at the top of that function named something appropriate like, say, state that is initailized to zero. Like this:


// this is just after the function header
static unsigned char state = 0;



In your states you would then increment it when the condition for a state being done is satisfied. I.E.:


switch(state)
{
case 0: // This is your turn state
if(*supposed to turn left*) // This would be however you can tell whether you are supposed to turn left or right
{
// So, we turn left however you do that
}
else
{
// This is where you turn right
}

// now we check to see if we can go to the next state
if(*done turning condition*) // This is your encoders or whatever you use to tell if you've turned far enough
state++; // Go to the next state
break;

case 1: // Next state
// Same idea for a long as you want
break;

default:
// If you reach here something went wrong
}



So, the idea is that you increment a state variable when you are done with a state.

PS Just as a side note, I have my defaults in my various switches calling a function named stupid(). All it does is printf() Stupid! and calls itself until it crashes. Anyways, that was kind of random. :)
Our team is actually going with two custom built analog sensors, we like analog because its not just a 1 or a 0, it brings back a range as it slides on and off the line, so you can actually program for it to follow a line quite fast with only one sensor as opposed to having 3 - ... 9 sensors :ahh:

Our sensors have a potentiometer on each that allows us to adjust the sensitivity and they each have their own LED light, so they could even follow a line if it were in a dark room. (not that following lines in the dark is useful for the competition, but its something its capable of)
Oh, you are most welcome  :D

We are using a pop down caster this year, ours has half an inch of travel (we added an internal stop to a 2" stroke cylinder, since thats what we had to use)


We made it just enough to pull the weight off the tires on our back end and to help from oversteer caused  by the caster we plan on dragging the tires just slightly (this also helps our stability with one caster, although we have a really low center of gravity as it is)
I agree with Collin and John and a few others.

Maturity is the key. Matches don't always go as expected, partners don't always do what you agreed on or what they said they would do, etc.
You need someone who can work under the pressure, stay under control and keep things moving. The two minute match is not for the timid.

Our drivers are usually also our captains, but that is not an absolute. The reason it that the captains are usually most experienced overall, learn and know the strategy, and can communicate well with other teams. The driver is the leader out there - captains are usually good leaders.

We use the out of season events for training / selecting new drivers.

I think one secret for solid performance is a consistent team on the field.
The four need to learn to communicate and work together, know what to expect of each other, and learn to trust each others judgement and ability. Rotating several peple in and out adds to confusion and leads to mistakes.\
Unfortunatly, despite our all-nighter, it looks like [190's robot](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?action=single&picid=6335) won't be able to make it. Our robot can damage itself in too many ways right now, and we would much rather take the time needed to get it up and running safely than rushing to make the scrimmage.

Our travel team will be there however, and we look forward to seeing all the other robots.
If there were a mouse on that wheel, I'd say we were looking at Mike's cranium from the inside ....

Taking a guess, I'd say that belt drives a mechanism for a hanging arm.  Knowing 25 that arm is probably long enough to legally attach to the bar from the pit area.

As far as I can tell, slightly adjusting all of the areas of alignment and replacing the battery has solved our problem. The drivetrain folks are coming back tomorrow evening, so I'm going to show them all of your replies and let them decide if it's fixed or not.

Our team will be at the Great Lakes regional, so I'll be sure and say thanks to you in person, Al.

Our team is using the vandoor motor to lift us up to the bar, with the built in gearing system.  However, a few weeks ago, I came across a thread that someone said something to the fact that they would see "many vandoor and window motor winches".  What motor are you using anyway?
Thanks for the suggestion. That pic was taken few week ago. I believe now that it's different.
Well we were using a fisher price motor
Thanks guys!
Give our site a good going thru.

our team is using a drill motor to hoist us up. we had some slippage at first but then we used pulleys to minimize the tension and it now works perfectly. we are also going up from the floor not the base.
We're probably gonna go for the bonus ball, but we have the possibility to manipulate the goal or the 2x on top of it, possibly at hte same time. Using our insanley fast robot,we could do it all, but with our luck, we'd explode immediately afterword. Otherwise, DANCE CODE!!!!!!!! But, we'd explode after that also, or get beaten by people who hate watching robots dance really badly.
I thought about that but our drill motors are already being used for our transmission,
You have to create your own code.  You either have to add some code to defaultroutine() (in userroutines.c) or from Processdatafrommasterup() (in the same file).  Basically, you can do a few things.  You can get creative with your code and kind of scale it so that it ignores the first 10 'ticks' of the joystick feedback, but you scale it so that you don't lose range of motion.  If you're really in a crunch, you can just flat out ignore some of the feedback.
if (pwm15 < 145 && pwm15 > 100) {pwm15 = 127;}
Something like this would just ignore whatever values in the joystick output you want.  There's a lot of room for creativity.  That depends on how creative/timley your coders are.  Best of luck to you.

Hey. I was wondering if it's possible to have no air coming out of the double solenoid during competition.  Right now we have it where the solenoid will act both ways, but until we pulse the solenoids, the pistons are retracting, which causes stress on our frame. Is there a way to have it where both of the solenoids can be off at the same time? Thanks.




one way is to use another solenoid inline before the solenoid you are using now.
ex) use a single before your double and plug the B and have a tube go from A to the double solenoid. have the tank connect to P.
so when there is no signal to the single, air will not go to the double resulting in no movement in your cylinders.

or,

use the configuration of being able to stop your cylinders at any point..
by just connecting a 3 way splitter to both exhausts of your double, and connecting another tube from that splitter to the P of another single solenoid. plug the B of the single and leave A open.
that way, you can stop the exhaust of your double by controlling the single. stopping exhaust of the double=no movement in your cylinders.

if you didn't understand or have any questions, i'll be happy to answer!
just pm or Email me.


Where in the default code do we slow the full speed of the robot.  I know this is simple but I just can not seem to find it.  Thanks



I'm not exactly sure what you mean by 'slow down' but I'll take a stab.

For as far as I know our team has been scaling back the speed of the robot by 50% unless the 'turbo' button is pressed on the drive stick.  This makes the robot more controlable, but still allows the driver to go full speed.

So here's how we do it, and generally how you'd scale any motor down:

&lt;beginner mistake&gt;
If I want to scale the motor speed down by 50% all I have to do is divide the speed by 2
&lt;/beginner mistake&gt;

This won't work because the 'zero' point where the motor doesn't move is 127, not 0.  So if you divide 127 (motor not moving) by 2 you get 63 which means your motor is moving half speed backwards.  In order for your motor to stop running you must add back 64.

Now my equation is motor_speed / 2 + 64.  Seems to work fine.

If you want to scale by 1/3 you divide your motor speed by 3 and add 85.

The general formula is:
(motor_speed * (1 / scaling_factor)) + (127 * (1 - (1 / scaling factor)))

Or you could approach it another way.  Instead of fooling around with adding the (1 - 1/scaling) factor, you can re-center your math around 0:

First thing you do is subtract 127 from your motor speed, then divide by your scaling factor, then add 127 again to get back to pwm values.  Quite simple, but remember to cast the calculation to an integer because an unsigned char can't handle negative numbers.

((motor_speed - 127) / scaling_factor) + 127

Both work.  One is probably more efficient than the other.  It's a matter of personal preference.  I hope this helps.

Someone please check what I wrote for typos, I've been known to make them.


Be careful that your robot isnt going to be popping wheelies as ours is now :cool: .

oh no. we actually get air after hitting a piece of wood during a wheelie. VERY cool..  only makesure the landing area is clear of small balls. we kinda did a flip after we landed :D

on our design, we just wont be able to do it with just one caster. at the least we're going to need to use two. inlign for and back.

but anyways, we might look into teflon or delrin.
but IS there a very easy way to make an omniwheel?
cheap and lightweight. it can be small. or actually, small is better.
we have a CNC mill, but its not exactly the fastest thing around.
will making one out of aluminum be too weak to support a robot?

I die for that.


a better way to set up a timer, if you are comfortable with it, is to use the processor interrupts. [www.kevin.org/frc](http://www.kevin.org/frc) has some sample code that can be cut and pasted into your code. I knew nothing about interrupts and timers and such and after a few hours staring blindly at the screen everything clicked. its really sweet how everything works. search chiefdelphi for other threads related to interrupt driven timers




Interrupts can be very dangerous and difficult to debug.  I wouldn't recommend their use for rookie teams, espically at this late date.


If IR sensing is required in future FIRST competitions, I honestly believe that FIRST should get its documentation straight, and that FIRST should supply specific instructions (and warnings about over-heating using a blow dryer) that will work every time. It would also be helpful if the beacons were to be mounted at heights ranging from maybe 12-24 inches.


Yes, I agree that the documentation was a headache that no one needed. Thanks for taking the time to write this up. I'll make sure that folks at FIRST read this.

-Kevin


Hi Brian,

Last week, our IR receivers stopped working after we replaced a few cable connectors on the circuit board they were soldered to. We also had one stop working when we replaced the heatshrink we wrapped the receiver in.

We didn't feel we used excessive heat in either case, but when we scoped the signal pin of the IR receivers afterwards, we found that they were no longer pulling all the way down to 0V, but were floating around 2-3V instead.

-Shawn...




The signal pins on the receiver shouldn't pull down to 0v if you're testing with the beacon code.  One of the beacons will give you a voltage of 4.4 volts on the sensors and the other will give you around 3.9.  This is due to your meter averaging the value received from the sensor over time.


How many people find themselves (when not working on the bot) rumaging through chiefdelphi all the time. This includes hitting refresh millions of times to see if someone responded to your post.



Or how about watching who's online to see if anyone is reading your post?

LOL, yeah, sometimes my team gets mad because i sneak away to surf on ChiefDelphi. :cool:


Does anyone have a working Tracker code that we could borrow to see if our IR Works. PM a link to it.

Sorry for asking, but our code did work...and now, it doesn't. We've plugged them into the right PWMs and the IR Beacons do work...and we've even talk to Kevin...from Kevin.org. It's getting very annoying.

I don't know how are our team got it's original name(the penguins) but last year we were forced to change it to The Flyers becuase that's our schools name.  After we won nationals, they didn't like that everyone was talking about how the penguins won rather then the flyers.  So you could always just use your schools mascot or your sponsers name.

NEW = North, East, West ... for the three schools that participate within the team (Appleton North, Appleton East and Appleton West)

Apple = Appleton

Corps = well, the word is pronounced "core".

Apple. Core. Get it? :) The first few years the team was around, their logo was indeed an apple core, with the team slogan being "bad to the core". Now the logo is a  [a modification of the FIRST symbol](http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/firstae2004/detail?.dir=/Albumless+Photos&.dnm=(Team+93)+NEW+Apple+Corps+logo.jpg) (an apple replaces the circle) and the logo is "Student conceived, student achieved!"


our arm operator is all giddy about using a playstation 1 controller :P




We wanted to use a PS1 controller but we couldn't find a way to change the plug to a 15 pin plug. We know how to change it to 25 but we didn't thionk it was possible to change it to 15.


Ok, last year, the rules clearly said #s had to be on 4 sides of the robot. I put it on our robot's left, right, and back side last year. The fourth side was the TOP. Well, the inspectors @ Chesapeake didn't like that so we had to oddly mount it on the front (which had a big gap in it for the stacker) with markers, paper, and tape ... Based on middle school geometry, I would consider TOP as a side :)


So no ones gets confused this year, the manual says:

"Teams must display their Team Numbers in four locations at approximately **90-degree intervals** around the **side** of their robot."

So don't try to place the numbers on the top, bottom and two sides ... I'm pretty sure that won't work. :rolleyes:

You can mount them any way its convinient really. A few zipties work exceptionaly well.

The Cats is for the Wilson Magnet Wildcats.
It's better than what Wilson Magnet used to be known as in the old days as West high. The Occidentals.
I don't even know what an Occidental is.
Our school's sports teams are the Lancers, so we're the RoboLancers. I don't like the name a lot, but hey, it works.

Team Name: Hart Burn

Our high school name was Hart High School so we had a good name to play off of. So we opened up the dictionary and found words that had the heart prefix. So we had a few prospects: Hart Attack (though highly overused at our school), Hart Condition which led to the Pacemakers (we were thinking of going with a medical theme), Hart and Soul etc.

After a few days though, Hart Burn was the winner and here's the criteria that may help your team:

1. You remember the name. Some teams are remembered by their number but most people know our team name. It's a comical concept so it sticks in your head. It was also easy to chant.

2. You can do a lot with it theme wise. Images of flames reinforce the name so they were on our tshirts, on banners, on our robot, on the bags we gave out, etc. The "fire" image also worked when we gave out fireball candies, hot tamales, big red gum. When we did brochures, our webpage, publications out to sponsors and the school, it was always easy to follow the basic theme. The name was a publicity person's dream because they had a lot to work with.

3. It's gender neutral so both sides of the aisle were happy.

4. It went along with our school colors, black and red.
Hmmmm looks like there are a few arms in there a tape drive component and an aluminum hook. Looks liek lots of fun.

I noticed in your original question that you said the numbers have to be 3 and a quarter inches wide. Actually the stroke has to be 3/4 inch wide.

Last year we had fancy, fire-rimmed letters, but the stroke wasn't wide enough (the flames didn't count) so we had to overlay the numbers with tape. It wasn't beautiful.


What do we know, a LEGO bot.

It's a Lego recreation of our bot. Very much an exact creation by the son of one of our mentors. He did a very impressive job, I must say.


Yeah, that is te basic idea. You would have a static variable at the top of that function named something appropriate like, say, state that is initailized to zero. Like this:


// this is just after the function header
static unsigned char state = 0;



In your states you would then increment it when the condition for a state being done is satisfied. I.E.:


switch(state)
{
case 0: // This is your turn state
if(*supposed to turn left*) // This would be however you can tell whether you are supposed to turn left or right
{
// So, we turn left however you do that
}
else
{
// This is where you turn right
}

// now we check to see if we can go to the next state
if(*done turning condition*) // This is your encoders or whatever you use to tell if you've turned far enough
state++; // Go to the next state
break;

case 1: // Next state
// Same idea for a long as you want
break;

default:
// If you reach here something went wrong
}



So, the idea is that you increment a state variable when you are done with a state.

PS Just as a side note, I have my defaults in my various switches calling a function named stupid(). All it does is printf() Stupid! and calls itself until it crashes. Anyways, that was kind of random. :)




Might I suggest using an enum or define statements to name the states.  state = 3.14159 is a bit more esoteric than #define AT_TARGET 3.14159 and then saying state = AT_TARGET (a bit less demanding on programmer's all-too-vexed memory too).  This also helps because you don't always want to say sate++ -- for example, in my code I have a state to turn left and another to turn right, and it all depends on which sensor sees it; so there is an if statement assigning state a different value based on the condition.
all the other teams seem to have way more funding then ours.

Do you know how much tension the chain might be under during operation?  I don't know of any suppliers of aluminum roller chain, but several sources have plastic chain that's much lighter than typical steel.  It is, as a result, also considerably weaker, rated for a tensile load of about 130 lbs. at best.

Try www.globalspec.com to find what you need.  For plastic roller chain, Stock Drive Products (www.sdp-si.com) and W.M. Berg (www.wmberg.com) are the most common suppliers.

We're doing the same thing, M, because our robot's shape isn't very lexan-friendly with all sorts of weird angles. We're using truck bedding tarp; you know, the waterproof stuff made to put over truck beds when it rains? It's light as a feather, and you can't get through it with a pin. It's pretty cool :)




Thanks for the suggestions once more, everyone.  I'll definitely see if I can't track down some of these materials locally and put them to good use.

It's being used for wings not unlike what many robots sported last year, and so it has to be resistant to "rigourous robot interaction."  We expect that it'll be in a place that lots of robots might want to be, and so we're expecting it to get beaten up badly.

Hey is that the name of your bot? That was the name of our bot last year!! Haha. What school are you guys from? Which regionals are you going to?
1. When you set the team number using the dip switches, connect the OI to the RC with the red Tether cable. Doing this allows the RC to "know" that the number of the OI that it is supposed to "listen to" has changed.

2. As for the red light on your rc, it could be caused by  several things.
-Is the OI on and communicating with the RC?
-Is there a code error?
-Is your battery charged?
-Another thing that could cause this light to be red is a short somewhere in your circuit. (This happened to us earlier). Check all of your connections to be sure that there is no short.

Well, the difficulty I'm having with understanding how it works seems to come from the apparent lack of another set of wheels beside the tri-wheel.  They may just be hidden from view.

If there are no other wheels beside the tri-wheel, what causes it to rotate and climb the step?  It seems like the rest of your robot would, instead, rotate around the tri-wheel, tipping down.


under which heading do we put the pressure switch code!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :yikes:




I don't quite understand your question - do you mean which function should it go in?  It really doesn't matter too much, although I think that ProcessDatafromMasterUP is the preferred place.


We're having a problem keeping our the clutch in our drill motors from slipping.  I recall that the drills from two seasons ago allowed for teams to directly remove the clutch, and was wondering if perchance the new drills have any sort of similar feature.  Any help would be appreciated.




Yes there is a way to remove the clutch.  By removing the front portion of  the gear box, you can get to the two pieces of the clutch which interact.  These are two round disks, one with 5 planetaries in it, and the other which houses the odd shaped gear which goes onto the final output shaft.  By soldering/welding these two plates together, you can take off the entire front clutch assembly.  This is the asembly starting with the big plast black cover, and as well as the spring and retainers which go along with it.

If you  need any help I may be able to take photos or explain better.  Hope this helps somewhat.

i can't wait to see what you guys can do this year, your bot last year was one of the best rookie bots ive seen.


can you delete the animation fames or smthing cause when i click on the key and delete it the boxes still animate... like i want to chang the way that they move but i can't because they are always moving when i try to set a  keyframe at a certain location because i had animated them before. I just want to strip all the previous animation basically.




next time when u ask specific questions like this, please make it a little more specific and understandable.

But what I think you are asking is how to undo or remove the keys from an animated sequence.  Just click on the object and there will be little boxes that you have to delete.  Sometimes motion still occurs because objects were linked or part of a group so you will need to stop motion on the group.  If that doens't work then open the (curve editor) its 2 boxes next to the material editor on the toolbar.  In there you will be able to adjust anything you want, including speed and curving of the object.  Good luck.
I wouldn't recommend it.

-The background, while very pretty, does kind of distract from the text on top of it
-The type is a little bit tiny and difficult to read
-If you turned your pictures in your gallery into thumbnails, you could put a lot more in (I like lots of pictures...)
-Good game description, clear and consise
-Good job overall, I have a lot of respect for someone willing to take on such a large task!

Team 237 Sie-H2O-Bots

Sie- short for Siemon Company, our biggest sponsor
H2O- abbreviation for water, our team is based in Watertown, CT
Bots- short for robot

In our third year we also came up with the subname of T.R.I.B.E. which is short for Taking Robotics Into Bold Experiences. This is a name we came up with during brainstorming to replace our old names. In year one ('99) we were known as the Black Magic Team but some people took it the wrong way so we quickly replaced it with the SunSeekers for the ('00) season but nobody on our team really liked it so we finally came up with and settled on T.R.I.B.E.


ok, i was reading over the interupt section in the PIC manual and it listed 8 different interupts on portB: 4 external interupts (RB0-RB3) and 4 i/o ports with interupt-on-change(RB4-RB7). For reference these are on page 110. But everywhere else it says that there are only 6 interupts. Does anyone know whats up with this?

There are 8 interrupts on the chip, but 2 (INT0 and INT1) are being used by IFIs code, so you only have 6 you can use.

From my testing, it looks like the only thing that causes the processor to choke is if you don't call PutData often enough. You can call GetData whenever you want, and you can call PutData as often as you want as long as it's more often than the cutoff time (not sure what that is).

I'm not sure if the master updates the pwms every time PutData is called, or just every 26.2 ms.
Are you looking for a 2d or 3d graphics cirriculum? Or both? Still graphics or video? I go to a vocational school, so, every other week, I'm in a computer graphics class all day, every day. We learn graphic design, designing of advertising, brochures, magazines, web sites, etc... As well as digital video fliming, editing, and production, and digital photography. We do a bit of flash animation, but no 3D (yet).

In 2d still cirriculum, you'd definitely want to learn Photoshop and Illustrator, and possibly Quark/InDesign, Dreamweaver, and maybe some other stuff too.

For animated, you should incorporate flash, and/or your choice of 3d program. Maya and 3DStudio MAX are the industry standards, but extremely expensive. (you'll need good computers to do 3d also)

For video, you'll probably need some good computers (mac or PC), and Avid, Final Cut Pro, or Premiere.

I assume that you'd probably be doing 2d design though (still and maybe animated) so you should learn basic design principles (i.e. Rule of thirds), and learn how to convey a thought or idea through the use of imagry.

I hope my comment helps you, and good luck on getting your class!


all the other teams seem to have way more funding then ours.
*sigh:(




One of the great things about FIRST is that you can build the most simplistic robot and still win.  Using the most ammount of money doesn't mean you are going to do well.
our main sponsor was AIL and they make radio Jammers and we are the redmen so we became the red jammers
Seeing the bellows and they also appear to be silicone they should seal well with the ball even with it's texture. Are you running a vacuum pump or just a venturi?

The webcast is encoded for Windows Media 9, so 9 should work...we have low bandwitdh, so expect problems... :rolleyes:

For some reason my Windows Media player 9 cannot view the webcast.  It's an asf file so I assume that's the right player.  Any thoughts?




It's working well for me, Ken, though there's a lot of buffering.  I'm using Media Player 8, however.

I'm quite surprised by how much tussling is going on, as well as how little hanging is taking place.
We were at 123 last time we weighed it.
The hanging is really awesome, when it happens, but most teams can't do it.  A team that could only hang would have a pretty good chance all by itself...

The deciding factor is human player shooting - if a robot can push balls to the human player and they can shoot most of the balls into the goal, they'll get points.  But if a team can hang, that negates five balls right there...

Multipliers are rarely used, though they can really decide the game if it's close.

Aaah, competitions are so exciting...

awesome job everyone!   :D
Something I've always wanted to try is using layered HDPE as a shell. Collect old shopping bags (the thin noisy ones you get at the grocery store) and layer them to create a protective barrier. This would be a very cheap option, as most people have lots of these bags laying around, would be lighter, and may stop must blunt objects like balls or goals (anything sharp will cut through it).

I really have no idea how this would work, but it's probably worth at least a test.

Well, the difficulty I'm having with understanding how it works seems to come from the apparent lack of another set of wheels beside the tri-wheel.  They may just be hidden from view.

If there are no other wheels beside the tri-wheel, what causes it to rotate and climb the step?  It seems like the rest of your robot would, instead, rotate around the tri-wheel, tipping down.





when not climbing the stairs the chasis moves so that we can pick up the 2x balls. The forklift is not pictured. When the chasis moves all the way down and makes contact with the floor this causes the entire tri-wheel to rotate and allows us to climb stairs. "theoretically"....  understand?

also, the little wheels are controlled independently of the tri wooden mechanism

we ended up not drilling individual holes, but more taking out big ovals and lost 10 pounds !!!
Overall I like the rep system due to the fact that yes, it does show new members who are the people that really do know what they're talking about.

Then again, I feel it has been abused again me - specifically, it has been used as a tool to express the person's opinion rather than if they approve of the post.  I feel like one person in particular (who is actually a moderator and should know better) uses the rep system repeatedly to express a grudge he has against me.

Disagreeing with a person's views is no justification for damaging his reputation.


I was wondering if anyone was using motors to hoist themselves up off the platform onto the bar, and what kind of motor they were using.  We tried ours yesterday without success, and were trying to be efficient with the time we have left to solve the problem.





What was the problem?  Was the motor backdriving?  We are using an FP motor with a ratchet system.  The ratchet is complicated to machine, we used a waterjet.
some sensors allow I2C input or PWM input, and we don't have access to the I2C
Lancaster Eagle Robotics left voice mail they wanted to come, but hadn't signed up. SCRRF Mark Miller said just show up.


Heads up Chatsworth Scrimmage teams - our UCLA anthropology students doing a communication study of our team plan to be at Chatsworth.
I think it'd be helpful to us if you described the problem you're having in a bit more depth.

Did the motor stall?  What diameter drum are you using for this device...which I presume is some sort of winch?  Did the motor backdrive?  Is there any gearing, or is the motor directly driving the lifting mechanism?
Our winch is driven by the output shaft of our drive train.
Well we can hold 6 balls, 7 if we're lucky, but the hopper isn't all thats on the bot.  NO we do not intend to catch any falling balls.  That seems unrealistic to me, but maybe someone will get lucky.
last year we worked our tails off and totally forgot about a name, and our coach called us the 'stars'. ugh. now we are 'phoenix rising', symbolising leaving the ashes of our former ineptedness behind. i like it.
We are using the van door motors. The diameter of the winch is 5/8" and it doesn't backdrive
(not our robot in the picture)

We used double pistons to create vacuum. It has about 2 inches of bellows. it works really good! pictures SOON to come!
awesome book! i couldnt put it down and it just made me want a segway even more then i already did

Wow, my neighbor is in that anthropology class and I was recorded in the Bruin Democrats v. Bruin Republicans debate for someone else in that class doing his paper in political communication. Just thought that was weird and that I would share...

Sadly, I have two papers to do this weekend so I won't be able to come and ref like I did last year. I hope that everyone has a great time and be sure to thank Chatsworth who graciously hosts this superb event every year. Good luck everyone, especially 691! :)
You HOPE is will be robst?  Looks pretty beefy to me.
Yeah, srjjs is correct.
aside from using all my wieght to get the ball off, it stays on pretty good!

Lol, believe me, I have no intention of it. I am still VERY sore, and I have a HUGE bruise where the car hit me, but other than that i'm great. I feel so loved, THANK YOU ALL!!   :)

By the way, the cat was not dead when i got there, that's why i stayed with it, but it did die afterwards. The driver that hit the cat didn't even stop... :(

Yep, looks all to familiar. We've had people in the past rupture our balls and then throw them in our storage closet for some unsuspecting person to try to reinflate them. We did have some of the small red balls puncture this year and I successfully repaired them by using a rubber tube repair kit from NAPA or if they had a small hole (pencil point size) I used Fix-A-Flat to inflate them. If you ever used that stuff it is essentially glue in a can and those balls now have an additional membrane making up thier "skin". I also sacrificed a needle point adapter doing that but if I try soaking it in laquer thinner I may be able to reclaim it.

Not to brag or anything....

We weigh 63 lbs with out the battery and the 18 pound arm. So a grand total of about 80 lbs right now.

Also we have a goal gripper, and side "wings" to push balls.

Hopefully we didn't build it TOO light... (hope duribility isn't a problem)

Good luck yall!

::enters detective mode::

Well, it doesn't look like precision work.  Looks like the culprit was in a rush.  You can tell by the way they duct taped the wound.  We need to look for a motive.  What kind of grudge could someone have held against the victim?  Could the victim have had some dirt on someone?  Have you determined the weapon used?  Unfortunately, unless someone comes clean, these kind of cases almost never get solved.  That poor ball... it was so young...  My condolences to it's family and friends.

In all seriousness, have you tried soldering it back together?  No, I'm serious.  Heat up where any tear may be and melt it back together.  Not the strongest hold in the world, but it will still hold up to normal robot interaction.

Ah ha!  It was the robot all along! :D
Were using the globe motor direct driving a 1 inch shaft, supported on both sides by the kit pillow blocks that are bloted to the frame. The ratchet mechanism is top secret  :D

Good luck!

just got back from the utc scrimmage... i saw one of the official "2x" balls, and there were no ridges.. is this correct?


Well its pretty obvious what it is, but i have one question.  Why didn't you just save the effort, money, and weight by buying one off the shelf?




Because we didn't see any that fit our criteria and was in stock at Digikey, and because it was a fun learning experience.


CRLF is
from the perspective of printf(), right?  Just making sure I'm bot being an idiot.




I had just
in the printf calls, \r is unneeded (afaik)
Try reinstalling, and when it gives you a large list of checkboxes asking if it should change PATHs and such, check all of them.
I believe that there are a few #define statements in one of the header file that change PWMs 13-16 to either IFI_PWM or USER_CCP.  That might be what you're looking for...
I think they have ridges but they shouldn't be a problem for getting a seal with what you are using.  There is some good non-pourous foam that you can use if that fails.  But I doubt it would.

Quick questions.  How do you get all three to have good placement on the ball?  Can you pick the ball up if only two get a good seal?  Is that a problem sometimes?
note that if you pause the robot, you should still be calling putdata every 26.2ms, otherwise the frc will shut down.

"Yellow Wave" -- We took everyone with us to regionals and had penants and our team color is yellow (or gold).  We won the team spirit and were champion at LSR.  The announcer began the refer to our team as the yellow wave of 1108  because the amount of yellow and penants.  He was the announcing in our division at national so we were the "yellow wave".

The way  The team got that name was in Orlando 2000. I believe the 522 coaches were wandering around the Gift Shops in disney.

As far the Team colors Purple and Silver just go together lol  :D  ;)   :cool:  :)
today at quincy there was a lot of ways of scoring and de-scoring the 2x ball... a few in particular were very good at it...

with the 2x ball thrown into an oppeonets net could be CRITICAL in the begining/middle of the match, where the other team is just starting to get thier small balls into their coralls... capping then would make 1 less goal to shoot at, and if you take out the stationary goal, and THEN take thier small goal to your end... it could make it very hard to score period...
we got our name by linking our mascots the gaels, and our sponsor are Sikorsky and have the black hawk helicopter so we became the gaelhawks


We are using the van door motors. The diameter of the winch is 5/8" and it doesn't backdrive




Same here.  We have a ratchet we can add if we need to but we haven't had too.  The van door motor works great if you rotate it around a small diameter.  And the small diameter will make backdriving more difficult.  Especially with braking.

Close to your andy too.  We used the pillow blocks with the 5/8" shaft.  And our ratchet is top secret too.


Hey is that the name of your bot? That was the name of our bot last year!! Haha. What school are you guys from? Which regionals are you going to?




Hey - didn't mean to steal your name - it was unintentional. Anyway, we're a third-year team from Plainedge HS, which is in N. Massapequa on Long Island. We go to the SBPLI Regional. I actually came up with that name after several other (less favorable) suggestions including "Six Pack" (even though we now have just four wheels), "Kill Switch", and "The Juice." Was yours spelled with the "k" too?

Anyway here is our lifting method revealed:
That extrusion arm is rotated to vertical pneumatically (a cylinder out of view). Then, a cable-pully-winch system telescopes the arm to the right height. The winch itself doesn't have enough power to lift the robot. That's where that huge cylinder comes in. It has a steel cable that attaches directly to the top extrusion (the one with the hook) and pulls it down (or, pulls the rest of the robot up). The arm doubles (triples?) as a big-ball-knocker-outer and a small-yellow-ball-getter-offer (if we ever get our autonomous down).

The result: (sorry for the low-quality image)

It would make it hard to score..But again you still want them to score..It's a fine balance and that's what makes this years game so challenging and fun.  I look forward to see how everyone attacks this problem and how it works out in the end.  We will find out soon enough.

I believe there's another thread about your drive train... look there.

As for pneumatics, you'll want to hook them up to solenoids, and then power the solenoids off of spikes (relays). Then, use the relayX_fwd and relayX_rev (X = 1 to 8) to control the various relays. Likewise, use the pX_sw_BLAH (X = 1 to 8 again, BLAH is the name of the specific switch/button - see ifi_aliases.h).
Our first year we were the "PHS Robo Dawgs" because our school mascott is the Bull Dog, of corse every one despised the name, (oh and uh no offence to any other robodogs team) and no one quite nows how it came about but it did so last year every one practicly shouted "NEW NAME!" So students would think up an idea and make a presentation to the team, then the team voted on the one they liked best. I designed the logo, and thought up the name "Cutting Edge" and it was voted for. It's now our permanent name. So my advice: Think one up! Be cleaver! And be creative. Then ask for a vote on it. :)
Good job...Our animation team finally finishes rendering today..Add sound and they should be done soon..Hopefully they will get it posted on our website.  I enjoyed the robotic voice over.

Thank you, Amber.  That sounds like exactly what I had in mind and Portland is reasonably close.  If I had a car out here, I'd drive down there and pick up the stuff myself.

By any chance, do you know how much it may cost, approximately?  We're a bit poor as a check we were waiting on hasn't yet arrived, to my knowledge.




Rip-stop usually comes on rolls in widths of 54" to 60" and at RCT can cost anywhere from 50 cents to $10.00 a yard. You should be able to purchase it by the yard. If they give you a catalog to look at, start with the blue pages first (if they still do that) and they will have the cheapest closeout stuff there. Generally though, it's all cheap compared to most fabric stores,.....plus, you can't find that stuff in most fabric stores. It's an independant (cheap) outerwear designer's dream.

Oh and they also deliver nationwide since they are a mail-order oufit.
Ask for samples of "HEAVYWEIGHT, RIP-STOP, NYLON" sometimes they will have the word "MACHO" in the description to indicate strength. I worked with some a few years back and it was like a nylon version of canvas that put regular canvas to shame in a paper thin sheet. You call them, they send you swatches for free, then you order and they ship it to you. You don't have to drive.


Not sure if I missed something in my CIS classes, but can someone offer some insight into this behavior?


int foo;
foo = 127 + 127;
printf ("%16b | %d
", foo, foo);
// prints: "1111 1111 1111 1110 | -2"



Is this a bug in the printf code, or is the compiler and microchip actually representing this using ones for the first 15 significant digits and a zero at the least significant position?




The compiler has a documented non-standard behavior that may relate to this. See below, from the C18 compiler reference manual (available on the Microchip site).

2.7 ISO DIVERGENCES

2.7.1 Integer Promotions
ISO mandates that all arithmetic be performed at int precision or greater. By default, MPLAB C18 will perform arithmetic at the size of the largest operand, even if both operands are smaller than an int. The ISO mandated behavior can be instated via the -Oi command-line option.

For example:


unsigned char a, b;
unsigned i;
a = b = 0x80;
i = a + b; /* ISO requires that i == 0x100, but in C18 i == 0 */


Note that this divergence also applies to constant literals. The chosen type for constant literals is the first one from the appropriate group that can represent the value of the constant without overflow.

For example:


#define A 0x10 /* A will be considered a char unless -Oi specified */
#define B 0x10 /* B will be considered a char unless -Oi specified */
#define C (A) * (B)
unsigned i;
i = C; /* ISO requires that i == 0x100, but in C18 i == 0 */



=====

It is confusing. I think you could cast the literal as an (int):


foo = (int)127 + (int)127;

Or maybe this?


foo = 127L + 127L;

I haven't tried these.
just make sure you cast all of the variables you pass to printf as (int).
We are using 5 motors and 6 pnuematic cylinders this year. Our arm is all pnuematic to hoist ourselves up to the bar. We also have two to shift our transmissions from high to low and vice-versa. We have 4 motors for our tank style drive train this year. We have a Bosch and a cim geared together on each side. And if you're wondering about the 5th motor, I can't tell you- it's top secret and it's also something I haven't seen on any other robots on CD. If I told you this would be my last post as my team would kill me for letting the cat out of the bag. :D  I will tell you one thing though, pay attention to team 237 at competitions ( Hartford and Trenton) and the nationals in Atlanta! :)


We ran out of speed controllers (our "genius" mechanics decided that we needed that many motors) and we are using relays and spikes right now.  I am trying to use relays in the code and hitting some problems.  Here is what I have now.

if(p3_sw_aux1 == 1){
relay1_fwd = 127;
relay1_rev = 0;
}

else if(p3_sw_aux2 == 1){
relay1_fwd = 0;
relay1_rev = 127;
}


else
relay1_fwd = 254;
relay1_rev = 0;

the p3_sw_aux1 part appears to work and the motor doesn't move when nothing is done to it.  But we are having some problems with that p3_sw_aux2 part.  Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.





Relay outputs are 1 or 0 values, forward is 1 (on) or 0 (off), same for reverse. They have no speed control. This also means you can assign values directly from buttons. I'm not exactly sure what you were going for, but this will make aux1 make relay1 go forward, aux2 make relay1 go backward, neither button and relay outputs no power:



relay_1_fwd = p3_sw_aux1;
relay_1_rev = p3_sw_aux2;



Hope this helps.


Quincy also had there game going today.
Beware ball handlers thats all I have to say.
And if you think you can pull other robots and goals around there is always someone better:D
This year is going to be fun. being alot of spares;)




#1 yes quincy was awsome today...

#2 amen

#3 yep yep yep

#4 understatement!!! =P
the relayX_fwd and relayX_rev variables don't function like pwm outputs - just assign them a value of 1 or 0.
Since we haven't gotten it to go straight with any consistancy, we are going to just let it run wherever it wants and take it from there.
well the links down im guessing because its over! lol... is there anyway for someone to split up the file and make a series of vids from some of the matches?
And......................it works.

Thank you to Vladimir and deltacoder.
the mobile goal is in the center of the field, and the dimesions of the field are in the manual - Im pretty sure its 48 feet long

there are two pressure switches - one is digital On/Off and has two screws for wires, and one is analog and has three wires - check the robot section of the manual for the proper way to connect them - the digital one goes to the digital inputs on the RC - you will have to sacrifice a pwm cable to connect it to the digital inputs, or buy the right connector and use the small gauge (grey) two wire cable that came in the kit of parts (KOP)

there is an input and a relay output already configured in the default code to run the relay (compressor) until the digital sensor detects high pressure, then turn the compressor off until the pressure drops below its lower trip point.

the default code is described in detail in the users guide in the documents section of innovationfirst.com.

I know everyone is in crunch mode right now - when you get a chance go through those documents - if you are working on the RC you will really want to know them inside out when you get to the regionals and something is not exactly right with your machine :c)
2 Bosch Drills
2 F-P
1 Van door
5 Cylinders

What they are used for?  Only time will tell.
glad your up and okay... wounds will heal in due time...
the receiver is a three pin device - looks like a square with a lens on one side - you should have gotten 4 in the KOP . you connect it directly to a PWM cable, but you have to cross the wires over - check the documents section of innovationfirst.com  - there is a whole page of links to files on the IR under 'beacon' in the list of docs.
here it is, the first look at team 174's SnoBot. This is the first time we got it to hang, it was the first try and it was unassisted!
The ultimate engineering attitude: "Why? 'cause we can." Why not? :)
the gyro actually is a yaw rate sensor - it tells you how fast the bot is turning on one axis (usually you point the axis up so you can tell how fast your bot is turning on the playfield as it steers).

there has been a lot of discussion and explainations - try the search function up in the orange bar - and search on gyro or yaw - you will probabally find what you need to know faster than I can type it out.
gnormhurst,
Thank you for that incredibly detailed, quick, and accurate post.  I'll make sure to read the C18 tech docs as soon as I can find the time.  So far I've been very happy with how compliant the compiler is.  I think you hit the nail on the head.

I hacked a macro to manipulate the datatypes I wanted to work with, but I *hate* macros.  I think I might just use the command line option you mentioned, after I research it's overall implications.

deltacoder1020,
If you look over my examples, the type of data I was passing to printf was already int.  re-casting it inside the printf statement won't change anything.
new picture are up

the robot has taken on a all new look.  a lot faster to climb and hang. the drive train can move almost anything.


few days left. All the pictures will be up by friday

if anybody could give feed back on our web site that would be great.

we were trying to make it easy for others to see this year robot and past robots.


How would you program a gyro and a yaw sensor? Also what specifically does a gyro and a yaw sensor return? Finally how do you install this? Thanks




I'm looking at last year's. It's BEI GyroChip Micromachined Angular Rate Sensor. I'm basing this on the spec sheet, I haven't used it, so confirmation would be nice! :yikes:

You would add the output to a variable ("Compass") once a second, like:


Compass = (char)(Compass + (int)(rc_ana_in01 - 127))


Like I said, once a second (Or what ever is convienient, I'd use a interupt if you know how).

Hopefully that gets you started, good luck!
We used suction cups last year so no one could push us off the platform.  I can't believe we didn't think of that this year.  We found one and tried it and they work really good but we already have a good design and don't have time to change it now.
Wouldn't it be that one is called, then in the middle of it the other is called? It would just bog down the proc, I think. try it!
I was at the UTC Scrimmage today, and did some refing.   Overall, I think teams were too worried about getting their robot working, to really play the game the way they intended to.
Anyway, some of the strategies used were:
Horde small balls into HP.  Most balls wins
Use big ball.  I only saw 2 teams do it succesfully, only 1 of them more than once.
Block chutes with moveable goals.
Hang on bar right away / prevent other team from hanging (The finals came down to the 2 robots who hung the best facing off).

Thats really it.
[Here's some pictures I got of robots and good action shots](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/index1.htm)
[And here's the rest of them](http://home.comcast.net/~rodriguezl/bots04/crappy/index.htm).  These ones are dark or blurry.
Here's a cool trick for the gyro sensors:

have your code print out a debug value, one per line, of the gyro sensor, and an increasing value before it.  So you get this:

1,127
2,127
3,127
etc...

Use hyperterm or some other terminal program with a large scrollback buffer, attach a long cable, and drive your robot up a ramp or some object you want to climb while capturing the output.  Copy and paste the entire thing into a text file with csv at the end, so foobar.csv or what not.  Open the file in excel and graph it.  It's great for finding thresholds and understanding what the gyro is trying to tell you at various points along the way.
We have some video up now. I don't know if it will work b/c it's supposed to be restricted, but here it is anyway:

In the Swamp shop 179 180 and 1251 got some full scale practice done. swampthing worked fine it caps and uncaps balls with no troubble. Spam had some control broblems, tho they blew us all away with their Holonomic Omni Drive. and 1251 got their Lasso device broken by swampthing and i helped them make an aluninum pice to make it work better.

GO TEAMS!!! I Had great Time An were All Glad you came
I would guess that mplab uses ansi (ascii, 1 byte) letters. It's based on the compiler, since it translates strings to binary. that's also where
stuff comes from.


That's neat. :) It's not too often you see people making thier own encoders from scratch.



Instead of spending $50+ on each encoder, we spent a total of (maybe) $5, and it works quite well.  I wired them up with a buffer and comparator to provide a digital output, which goes to two interrupt pins.  Works great  :D
I don't know of a single website off hand but I do know that a lot of the different veteran teams websites contain pictures and sometimes descriptions of the previous years games. I do know that our teams site will (www.team237.com) but it is a relatively new site and some of the links aren't up yet.
I would do it anyway. The path you posted is 67. Real, real close. I put my stuff in C:\FRCCode\_Projectname\*. Put a folder shortcut on the desktop if you really want it on there (PM me, and I'll tell you how).

The path of the exe and the h doesn't matter; I think that's passed in the command-line args.


is there any reason why one can't turn the 4 interupt handlers into function with an extra argument telling which ir sensor picked it up? it wouldn't be that hard, but maybe two interupts may be caled at the same time and they might fight eachother. who knows? do you?

-Kesich




It completely depends on your definition of "streamlined."

Generally speaking, you want interrupt handlers to be as fast as possible and to do as little "work" as they can.  From this perspective, duplicating large sections of code is more desirable than calling a subroutine, which will cause a "context switch" so to speak...  Push the stack down, create new local variables, etc...

With that said, the overhead involved in calling a subroutine is *very* small, so it might be worth it to save code space by using a generalized function.  As for two interrupts fighting with each other, the setup at present is that all 4 IR sensors are tied to the single low priority interrupt pin, so they'll never fight each other.

Other than that...  Try it and see.  I'm about to massively re-work the IR tracking code to use a single tracker with 3 IR sensors rather than 2 dual sensor trackers.  The idea will be to have the middle sensor have nothing but a very narrow tunnel vision.  I'll let you know if I run into problems generalizing the current implementation.

We don't need 2 trackers to calculate distance, we'll be using the tracker mostly for turning, so it's more important for us to get a dead-accurate lock on one of the beacons.
RAGE is sad that there is no red. LOL :D


I believe that there are a few #define statements in one of the header file that change PWMs 13-16 to either IFI_PWM or USER_CCP.  That might be what you're looking for...




No, that's not it. The Setup_PWM_Output_Type() function is to set up the specifics of the PWM signal. if you don't use IFI_PWM for all 4, you have to set it up yourself (see comment in the default code). this is done in User_Initialization().

Thank you to team 179 for hosting that. It really helped us. We weren't really having control problems exactly; we just moved things by hand so that we could be there to stop or catch anything if it didn't work. The switches have been tested and work fine. The driving of the omni-directional drivetrain was a little crazy, but we tweaked it a bit. Most of the problems are getting used to driving the thing since it is very different than tank treads. Our drivers got a lot of practice on your field today and we think we got the science down, for now. Lets see if that is still true at UCF.


How do you grind down drill motor gears? Is this an safe thing to do? We don't need the gear but we want to use the motor.

~Fred




I don't know if it is safe or not, but we have done ot with excellent results.  Other teams say they have not had such sucess though.  I don't remember exactly what we did, but i can ask the kid who did it.
Ok, i believe you. Actually ours was spelled Tork, with the oppisite caps so i guess its "different" Were in San Jose, CA and are in the Sacramento and Silicon Valley regionals. Unless you have some west coast contacts ;). Our bots caps (doesnt seem theres many of us :)). Anyways, good luck!
-Jackson
yeah we had problems but we'll figure them out-- it's not a spam bot without a million problems

but thanks swampthing for letting us test!!! spam luvs u guys
As for the first part, ask Kevin.

As for the second part, I think that printf is the only one you can exclude, but only if you aren't using printf() anywhere. And this year's mem is huge, so if you filled it already, tell us!
That is sooo awsome!!! when my team and i saw it we were all freaking out it looks so cool!!! Suction cups didnt even cross my mind but now i totally wish it did! everyone was comparing is to ...i think star wars or something... but it was sooo cool! good luck to you i hope it works out for you... :D

We're doing the same drive, except that they're geared together. Make sure the free speeds match, but that's a mechanical thing.
Woo, old post back up.

I like manga/anime just as much as any good book.

In speaking of Shonen Jump, I like it for a few of the manga, Naruto, Shaman King, and Hikaru No Go. One Piece, and Yu Yu Hakasho aren't bad. But the rest are just crappy. Naruto is awesome, over the rest. It's awesome, I'd rather watch/read Naruto or Cowboy Bebop over most anime.

Time to test your knowledge. Who's heard of the following anime/manga:
Battle Royal, and Hell Sing. You get a cookie if you have.

er... where do I ask him, or may he see this post?
And I did fill it up :D, Its a mix of a heavily modified tracker, a math library, and my drive system that (hopefully) makes accurate speed/power ajustments relitive to the maximum speed of the bot as seen with the encoders. Thanks!

Having the same problem too.  Quicktime DV/NTSC codec is bad.  The Quicktime Cinepak one is even worse.  We'll submit it like that though.  Just as a comparison, we exported our animation in the sorensen 3 codec (which comes with quicktime), and it was 1/3 the size and 10x the quality at least.  That'll probably be the version for our own keeping and the internet version.

I think that that's what I was talking about, sorry, I didn't have the code in front of me...


This is our first year as a team, and we have no idea how to switch channels.  We heard about usinga dongle, or something, but have no idea where to get one, (or build one).  Anyone have any help? :confused:



Check out innovationfirst.org, and look at the OI documentation.
Specifically, the competition port area...

there's something about 4 guys alone in a crate for a few hours or a couple days. locked away and without food or light! :ahh: . kinda turns ur  :D  to a  :yikes: . lol. um kiddin man ya'll have fun
Interesting way to cut down on travel costs for your team. :p
We rendered everything in .mov and then transfered via pen drive to an ibook and used imovie to compile everthing.  Worked pretty good.
Very cool.  The 4 way split screen was a really neat idea.  The voiceovers maybe could have a had a little more 'impact'


Congratulations to teams 1099, 782, 839, and 173 on winning the UTC scrimmage in Suffield, CT.  Our alliance of teams was great-we were able to play many aspects of the game well.

Also congratulations to teams 716, 195, and two other teams (sorry I forgot what numbers you guys were).  You guys were a great alliance as well. :cool:



Congradulations to you as well becuase you would have been a formidable opponent with that arm of yours, very nice work.  I would like to thank team 1099 for picking us and team 839 for being a great alliance partner.
Well top secret rachets are all nifty and all, but we're using a window motor driving a winch that we bought at a boat store.  If you're in a time crunch, which you must be by now, I think this is your quickest option.  Just go to a boat store, look for a lightweight winch with a removeable handcrank that looks like it'll be easy to adapt the van door or window lift motor to.
The motor is the same as the 2003 van door.
i got this...

There was a problem:
• There was a temporary problem with the server. Please try again shortly.
• The password is incorrect.
• The league is not in pre-draft mode.

*edit* worked second time... im in

You guys did a good job of defense on the last match stopping the other alliance from getting to the bar.  We were able to get up on the bar and get up 50 points ahead.
I've tried several times and can't get the "2004 animation" link to work. :confused:  Does anyone else have this problem? I'm connecting through a LAN to a broadband cable modem and I also have quick time already installed on my laptop.

It may take you a while to view it since it is a 180mb file.  I just played it in the browser and it worked fine.  When you click on it, it should play in the browser, and if you right click and choose 'save target as' you can save it to your computer.  I recommend the second so that we can save up on bandwith. :]


Given that A and B are the lengths of the segments of the line between the beacons bisected by a perpendicular line to your robot of length C and the angles from that perpendicular to the beacons are given as T1 and T2.




You're trig is fine.

I've also been playing around with using the IR beacons to keep track of absolute position, and I've come up against a few ... obstacles.  So maybe you can help me.

It's just that it's not so easy to keep track of those two angles, T1 and T2.

At the beginning of a match, you know both your position and heading (because you know where you've put your bot).  Hence you can quickly calculate T1 and T2, as well as A, B, and C.

(You may recall from your old trig class that this is the angle-side-angle triangle congruency theorem.)

If you go straight ahead, then you can still keep reading off T1 and T2 because the altitude constructed from your bot to the midline of the field is still in the same place.

In fact, as long as the bot is perpendicular to that midline, you can figure out exactly where you are.

If you turn somewhere along the line, you can still find T1 and T2 *as*long*as* you know the angle from that altitude to a line parallel to your robot.  This angle is your heading.  You have a number of ways to keep track of heading -- you can use a gyro to sense your angular velocity, you can mount encoders on your wheels to count revolutions, and so forth.

However, your absolute position (i.e., the values of A, B, and C) will only be as accurate as your heading; in fact it will be slightly less accurate because of the (presumably small) amount of error introduced by the IR sensors.

The upshot of all this is that if you want to know you're absolute position, it's probably a little easier and little simpler to just use gyros and/or rotary encoders, which in the above setup would be necessary anyway.  My conclusion: that if your autonomous objective is to shoot towards the 10 point ball, use the IR trackers.  You don't even need any trig to do that; it's easy to find your distance *relative* to one beacon or the other.  But at this time (which is pretty late) I haven't come up with any way to use the IR trackers to gauge *absolute* position.

I'm not saying it can't be done; I just haven't found a way.  For now, I'm stuck with plain, old, dead reckoning.  If any other team has a solution, I would be eager to hear it.
very nice guys, good luck!

Foxtrot or Calvin & Hobbes?
WEll i am just going to keep my thoughts to myself i would just like to say a few things

i agree with ken he has hit the points that i think

One thing i would liek everyone to look at
We see this going on and i mean shure they built the same robot and it does mostly the same thing. But next year i mean what if teams join uop see the task and make two robots cover all the aspects of the game
example
Say next year my team 710 and like 108 team up to make two different  robots that work together. we both go to the same regionals., maybe we wont be paired together in qualfication matches but what stops us from picking each other in elminations so if we seeded like 1st or 2nd we could pick 108 and wouldnt we be unstoppable cause our robots were made to work together.

I thought it was great that they worked on designs together but i think they crossed the line makin each others parts. IF my team only had to think about one thing (arm or drivetrain) would it make it alot easier. I mean that is like using only half your brain

Both these teams are looked up to in the FIRST community and i still look up to them i just wish they would of thought a little more about there descion to work together and how it would effect the rest of us
We had enough money to pay our down payment for the EDU, so we have the 2004 EDU kit, but an old full size RC, or will have an old full size RC.

I guess a better question would have been, After the battery and the controller, what is the bare minimum of other electrical stuff.  We're running on a 300 budget, hence the reason most of the other stuff was donated.

Hmmm.  It was rather depressing when we first found out that we couldn't officialy compete, but I've come to realize a practice year is definiely a good thing.  I'm almost glad we weren't stuck trying to figure all of this out in six weeks.

then you are going to want to control the motor using a Victor, and thus a PWM. set the variable pwmXX (XX being the number of the output the victor is connected to) to a number from 0 to 255 - 0 is full reverse, 255 is full forward, and 127 is neutral (stopped).

Why such large sprockets?  Also, what size and wall thickess is your frame material?




Thats a very good question.  I hope we are planning on downsizing them, but the problem might be that we can't get smaller ones on island.  For the second question, its 1"-1", 1/8" wall aluminium (welded together).



The robot looks good. The spiral wrap you added was a good addition, really neatens it up. I just want to point out that you might want to add chain tensioners. The one on the left appears to have a bit of slack.




Thanks, I liked the spiral wrap too, its a lot better than the last two years where a cable actually got severed in the chains.  And the tensioners was another thing I was hoping to doing.  I had a plan for this and was wondering if it would be a good idea.  I was thinking about putting a piece of HDPE between the chains, so the chains cut it until the rollers touch, keeping it from being cut any more.  Once the rollers touch, the chain should slip on the HDPE, but still be tight from the pressure upwards.  So if you or anyone else could tell me if this is a good or bad idea, that would be great.

Thanks again,
Bobby
There is only one plastic strong and tough enough.  LEXAN.
All, that is All of the other and cheaper choi :) ces will crack and let you down. I can tell you this after 4 years of experience.
If you're using any of the full-sized motors, you will need some Victor 884 Speed Controller modules (883s will probably do for now) and/or some SPIKE Relay Modules.
Just so ya'll know this I drew up in Rhino 3d in a couple hours, its not a rendering from our animation.
Oooh cool!  Have you hooked them up yet?  It'd be interesting to know how well they run.  These look custom made; was it difficult?
any chance of using lexa or plexiglass for a base is nto good. I am guess you are a rookie team. We use lexan to protect the compenents of our robot and for skins. Lexan is strong but not made to be a base. I would not quit yet but i would suggest go get some wood like mentioned about and just build it out of wood. Especially with a game that i think is gonna involve alot of contact between robots like last year youa re gonna need somethign that holds up


what did they put controls on before 1995?




Before the platforms were used, controls were just held by the drivers and operators in hand as they stood on the side of the field.
the header/title image at the top of the page does not need to be a rollover, and contributes very little while increasing page load time. I'd recommend just making it static.
If you want it to move exactly 270 degrees, you will need some sort of feedback system.  I would recommend a pot - do you know how to wire one up?
After some testing in gcc, I figured it out.  The more descriptive errors helped.  The page I was reading was incorrect about the ordering of the type name versus the variable name.  I'm actually passing a bitmask value that I #defined as a bitmask, but I just did it this way so it's easier for people to understand the pointer stuff that's going on.  It's so nice having full ansi C.

We have two 3/8" drill motors, two Van Door motors from ?2001? I think, and two other motors that I'm not sure what they are.  They are about 2 in long and have a square shaft covered in plastic that lies perpendicular to the motor.  I'll take a picture at meeting tonight and post it.
Then you will need some speed controllers for the drill motors and the van door motors, and spikes for the window motor.

Honestly, I believe that at the end of it all, no one will give this topic a second look if team 254 and 60 aren't very successful this year. If they do manage to do very well, then everyone will be on them saying they were able to do so well because of an "unfair advantage they created by working in tandem with another team." If they manage to do well as an alliance, then everyone will be extremely bitter and take things to the FIRST level. There, thats a sweeping generalization for you, success driven prosecution. Not only does the aforesaid highlight why we really care about the collaboration of these teams, but it also highlights a problem I have noticed in alot of places, including FIRST: everyone has a knack for acting in their best interest, but not for acting with the intent of finding the most suitable compromise. I have to wonder, though, if everyone uses gracious professionalism and what is in the "Spirit of FIRST" as a crutch for their arguments, then do they not see that they are defeating themselves? I mean, there is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the partnerships between 60 and 254 (I still have mixed feelings), but don't do so in a way that makes you look narrow-minded, because then yelling begins, and then all things after are unusable.

I've have seen discussions in the past that attempted to girdle a "controversial" topic, but failed miserably. After such failure, some well-known poster would submit a lengthy post stating why we should interact better as a community, and how we should allow discussions to grow. Many of the participants in the discussion would apologize to each other and the thread would be closed. One would think after such episodes that no more will happen, but thats often far from the truth. A few weeks later another controversy, or conflict of interest would arise and the cycle would repeat itself.

This thread has an interesting topic, one that should be discussed to a great extent. I would hate to see the mods have to close it because they start having flashbacks to other threads that ended with individuals having changed opinions about each other, and with teams hating each other. This thread is not there yet, so lets keep it that way.

I'd take this post as a quick and dirty history lesson on chiefdelphi discussions gone bad. The moral: think privately, then share openly your refined opinion. Readers should see the best of what you have to say, not just the first thing that comes to your mind.
Didn't plexiglass(acrylic) used to be illegal on FIRST robots since it is so brittle?  I know some acrylic got mixed in with our excess stock of polycarbonate, found out the hard way when it shattered while trying to be bent.  Eitherway, polycarbonate frames have been done before.  In 2001 we had a [robot with no structural metal](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=337&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose)
Browsing the gallery, it looks like team 49 also did a [robot made primarily out of lexan](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=386&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose)

So yes its possible, given your time crunch though, wood might be easier to get and to work with.  Just get a drive train that runs first and go from there, there's still plenty of time left.  Good luck,

I agree totally wiht you thats what i did cause if i posted right when they said  they were workign together i would had bad reputation. Please everyone think about what youpost before you post cause i would liek this thread to stay open to see were this goes

My thoughts up above our toned way down from what iw as thinking intitally
I agree, if you absolutely must use a plastic, use lexan. It is more durable, and while it does splinter and shatter, it is less likely to do besides plexiglass. If you use this, you have to support it, using plexiglass or lexan will no support is a sure way to have a base be totally demolished. Supporting the base with aluminum extursion at stress points (if you can, ask an engineer to evaluate your design and offer advice on where to support it) is a very good idea.

Now Ken is also right. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using plywood as a base. In fact, one team that comes to mind that uses a wood base every year and is one of the well known teams in FIRST is Team 173 Rage. Every year they use a wood frame (which I'm not mistaken is supported by aluminum brackets). It may splinter, but with the brackets, it's an easy fix. Just put a sheet of aluminum or steel over it, bolt it on, and you're ready to go. I bring up Rage, because they are one of the well known teams that uses a wood base, and have so for years.

And yes, if you turn up at your regional with your robot unfinished, it's guarenteed other teams will come over to help you. No team is going to look down upon you, in fact most teams will do everything in their power to make sure your robot works and is able to compete. That's the great thing about FIRST, everyone is willing to help each other to make sure the competition is as good as it can be and everyone has a fighting chance.
The 3" PVC is hooked directly to the Fisher Price Motor.  There is a ramp behind it gives the balls support as they go up.  It is a bit slower than we would like but seems to work just fine.

To get the balls out the motor is reversed and they all come out.  We have had very few problems jamming balls because the opening is just wide enough for two balls to go through.  More testing will be conducted though.

Thanks for all the encouragement!
You MUST use the ground stud as a gatherer for all the incoming grounds. In the set up you have now, this is not possible.

Looking at the pneumatics guide the picture they have of the double solenoid (the t looking one) shows the wires connected to the side. On ours there's just the pins and no connector.

I looked around our shop for like 2 hours and couldn't find anything. Do we have to make our own or can we buy them and get them really really soon?





where are you located? i might be able to mail your our extra from last year.

they defently came in the kit though, they are very small so keep one of the new guys looking.
I think someone is trying to decieve us, cause well it looks suprisingly similar to 302 2003.  :)   However I wouldn't be suprised if the abilities you listed are what your actuall robot can actually do.

Allison
I don't know how physical this years matches will be but last year we shattered the side of a lexan robot in our first practice match (they ran into us).  I still have a piece of it.

I would use wood and the aluminum for the kit.  You can definitely get something driving and it will cut down on the repairs you will have to do at competition.  You can compete if you can make something that can drive every match.
If the clip does pop out, can i just push it back in?  This happened to us and we think the shifter may be not engaging when it is supposed to be.  Is that related?


I have had the same problem.  However, I dont believe the aliases are wrong but rather the LEDs are incorrect.  Red now means the M+ is at 12v (M- gnd) and Green means M- is at 12V (M+ gnd).  I say this beacause I am using a single solenoid which is spring return, so I only power M+, which the red wire of the solenoid is hooked up to.  I simply toggle that relay's fwd bit to operate the solenoid and it works.  I would not go changing the polarity of your compressor because reverse polarity could seriously damage it.




I haven't hooked up a multimeter to the relays yet, but I'm almost 100% postive you're incorrect about this.  If this were true, it would imply that the robot controller not only tells the relay what polarity to set itself to, but what color to light the LED to.  This would require 4 bits of information to represent, and we're attaching the relay to the controller with 2 signal wires.  I seriously dobt they implemented a serial communication protocol between the controller and relay.

The claim you made holds some incredibly serious implications...  You might want to back such claims up in the future, because even though I'm sure you're wrong, I'm going to have to test this myself because it's not worth blowing out components a week before ship.


Honestly, I believe that at the end of it all, no one will give this topic a second look if team 254 and 60 aren't very successful this year. If they do manage to do very well, then everyone will be on them saying they were able to do so well because of an "unfair advantage they created by working in tandem with another team." If they manage to do well as an alliance, then everyone will be extremely bitter and take things to the FIRST level. There, thats a sweeping generalization for you, success driven prosecution. Not only does the aforesaid highlight why we really care about the collaboration of these teams, but it also highlights a problem I have noticed in alot of places, including FIRST: everyone has a knack for acting in their best interest, but not for acting with the intent of finding the most suitable compromise.





while i agree with the rest of your post i have to show an opposite side to this.  because Kingman and the Cheeseypoofs broght this up in such a dramatic fashion...i don't see it not becoming a national FIRST issue.  to me, your argument is like saying steroids are bad because they make people better athletes.  and if the people weren't better...we would't care.  that isn't true.  if the athletes weren't better kids wouldn't take them with such disregard for the future that they do...but steroids would still be incredibly harmfull.  successful or not, 60 and 254 are hitting uncharted (good? bad? who knows?) territory in FIRST that will almost have to be addressed.  i do, however, wish both teams the best of luck this season.  it would be kind of interesting to see them against each other at nationals.  it kind of (emphasize "kind of") reminds me of when 45 (another well recognized team) donated their 'toy'-robot (sorry...didn't have another word to use) to another team for use at a competition and wound up losing to it in a match.  it'll be interesting.
You can actually force balls in from the bottom when you already have 10 or so in there?  That's kind of surprising.


If you want it to move exactly 270 degrees, you will need some sort of feedback system.  I would recommend a pot - do you know how to wire one up?




You need to read the 2004 Programming Reference guide located here:
http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/2004_Programming_Reference_Guide_10-29-2003.pdf

You also need to read the 2004 FRC Default Code Reference Guide:

The second PDF document explains in detail what's going on in the default code that Innovation First provides.

> I agree, if you absolutely must use a plastic, use lexan.

I disagree there are few other plastics that are better suited for a frame than lexan.  Polyethylene is probably one of the better plastics to use for frame materials.  It is easy to machine and very durable. The names to look for are HDPE (same stuff used in the fields) and UHMW.  My best guess is that the gearbox and mounts are some form of polyethylene.
Your in bad shape when the clip pops out.  This is what the rubber band is for and I urge everyone to use their.  We already lost a transmission because the zip ties we were using loosened up and the pin popped out and the place shifter broke.  Use the rubber band to hold the clips in place and use zip ties to keep the shifter in place.  It the clips do pop out you will have to look at the motor diagrams, I think their is on in the white paper, because I don't think it works quite right if you just pop the pin in.
Okay.  What do speed controllers and spikes look like, how do I explain to the team what they do, where can I get some, and how much do they cost.

Allison

PS- Sorry about asking so many questions but I really know nothing about electrical, and as I am the team leader I am expected to know something.


I thought you were so depressed from not being the current UFH anymore that you had to drown yourself in robot building.




Actually, I think I used Patriots Day as an excuse so that I didn't have to think of  3 Questions...im running out of them!  Be happy Joe...thats one less day everyone has to catch up to you!


Actually, it depends entirely on how long it takes to execute your Interupt Handler code.  If you keep triggering interupts before the last one finished, you end up interupting the interupt.  Do this too many times and you blow the stack and the thing crashes.

So, the REAL question is: How much time has IFI given us to service an interupt without blowing up their code?

Chow for now,
Steve




Interrupts are disabled while executing an interrupt handler.  This is why it's important to keep interrupt routines small, so you don't miss events.
heres a very helpful power point presentation by the people at Innovation First [http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/C_help.htm](http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/C_help.htm)
my team would also like one and will trade some of our extra stuff.

we have the one from this year that we plan to keep on the robot but we want an extra one to play with in the off season.
I would think so...But at what pressure?  Does it need to keep a certain pressure and force like it is for lifting?  I thought the tanks were like 16 cu. in. I not sure if that is together or by themselves.  And 3/4 of the 20 feet of tubing??!!
just look in your pneumatics box... if you see wires then these are what you are looking for. (they took me about a 30 minutes to find)
I finally decided to chime in on this issue.  Since I am part of this "conspiricy to undermine the values of FIRST" [/sarcasm], I decided to tell a few details that people not involved in this would not know.  This is not an attack on people or their arguements, but an attempt to straighten out a few facts.

The arm did not arrive in the mail at our lab pre-built.  The pieces that needed to be machined/welded were done, but we assembled it and fixed it. Some people may say that this trains us to be factory assembly line workers.  However, we helped design it, know how it works, and could put it together without instructions.  Secondly, It did not work right after we assembled it.  For example, We sheared the bolts holding the drive sprocket to the lower part of the arm, so we *engineered* a solution.  "We" means the people in team 254's lab at that moment (about 8 students, 1 engineer and **2** college students.  We then called Kingman and informed them of the problem, not the solution.  That is just one example.

Some people have said that we (the students) are not as invloved in the design process.  However, we had numerous hours of meetings discussing the design of the robot (for example, of the extensions for ball herding).  We met on Monday and spent two hours discussing different solutions to the problem that we saw.  We then compared our results with Kingman's results.  Then on Tuesday, we spent another two hours deciding which design (of our two favorites from Monday) we liked best.  Then, we called Kingman and it happened that we both agreed about the best solution to the problem (that we had room/weight/resources for).  Again, this is but one example.

Another thing people are saying is that we should do this with a rookie team.  We decided to collaborate with Kingman (and they with us) because we both felt that we had experiences to bring to the table.  We do mentor rookie teams, and I am not saying that we do not learn from them.  However, we feel that our strengths complement each other.

Thank you for all your feedback to our experiment.  Please try not to attack something you do not know all the details about.  However, continue to give your input, especially if you have something new to bring to the table.

Sorry for the long post.  This is a complicated subject. :ahh:
&lt;sarcasm&gt; These rubber bands serve a far more important purpose. They are to be used instead of screws, bolts, super glue, duct tape, or whatever you wanted to mount your motors with. This can be achieved by creating a simple figure 8 with the band, wrapping one side around the motor, and the other around some kind of shaft &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
Now while this may seem like a good idea, remember that rubber bands can snap really easily, so it's not advisable hehe.
You know, there's a couple of things I'd like to say about this...

- I can see where you're coming from. When I came back to the forums full-time, one of my early posts got negative criticism because they didn't like my style of writing. And I was pretty pissed...who are these people who never even knew me back then, and why are they allowed to say that my points aren't valid? I know a couple of older FIRSTers who graze the forums every now and then who have the same feelings towards reputation.

- People like to criticize more than they like to praise. We don't give eachother enough credit, and I wish it was different...but that's the way things are.

-I LOVE getting reps, especially from people I don't know and people with reps higher than my own. My face literally lights up *every single time* dlavery gives me positive reps...because I know my opinion mattered enough for him to make the couple of clicks and think of something interesting to say to cheer me on.

So...maybe some solutions? I know! Mid-Season Resolutions!
-**I resolve to give out more reputation.** My favorite area of the reputation area is the comment area. If you've recieved a rep from me lately, I try to always put in a word or two either of praise or of ways to make it more palatable (lately it's been a LOT of words!).

-**I also resolve to not give out negative feedback without a comment.** This way we know what we're doing wrong, as opposed to knowing someone thinks we're wrong but didn't care enough to say why. It also makes us think before making those couple of clicks.

Dont be scared away from posting. Voicing our opinions is what makes us human, voicing our opinion frequently is what makes us FIRSTers. :D  And you definitely have valid points to make, so if we all resolve (or at least keep in mind) to show eachother that we appreciate one another, I think that we're well on our way.

Hope that helps!
Looks nice but expecially in the first scene there needs to be some light work done. But great job!
Couldn't a woman stop her?
It says in the document not to restructure.  We took this to mean that we could not change the font, margins, or add more than three lines to each section.  However, we did add a space between each section to make it more readable.  Have you asked on the Q&A if you can change margins/font?

Thanks,
Most likely Autodesk has just taken them off Steamline to clear room, because I don't see 103's form on there either, and I remember that one being on there for sure while we uploaded ours.

If you get a response back from Autodesk, let us know, but I'm not too worried since our team number's folder is still there in that animation submition folder.
Yes... they're custom made, but's a little hard to do, and we're already in test phasis.
i've already looked at it but it's a BIMBA ORDER form, i was looking for SMS order form.


You MUST use the ground stud as a gatherer for all the incoming grounds.



Apparently not, from the Q&A today:

> Q:	According to the "robot power distribution diagram", all ground wires go thru the ground stud. R44 allows connecting directly to the fuse panels. Can we loop from panel to panel (as shown for the red+) or is the ground stud required?
> A:	Either way is acceptable.
hmmm, i wasnt aware of that update.. thanks for keeping an eye out!
is that a real pic for the white board? or was it just some quick mspaint work?
I tested the relays with the multimeter - when I set relay1_fwd to 1, the spike turns red and the multimeter reads -12v.  When relay1_rev is 1, it's green and the multimeter reads 12v.  This seems backwards to me...


It's hard to predict what the weather is going to be in a months time. By the way the North East has been lately, I would suggest dressing warmly, looking at temperatures probably between 40F-60F, but it's still a month away. This is based on how the winter and weather have been recently though.




40-60 that would be a heat wave where I am.  I will deffinately be bringing shorts and t-shirts.... And maybe a few pairs of pants just in case. :yikes:
RAGE team 173 - www.rage173.org
hehe, Jon, on a side note, you guys ready for the snow we're gonna get tonight?
I think they retail for $120 or so each, but I'm sure some teams will have extra 883s which can no longer be used in competition, but are fine for everything but the latest drill and chiaphua motors.  The Victor is a square base with a LED on it, and a mini tower coming up with a fan mounted at the top.  The SPIKE is a little box which has either a red or blue SPIKE label on the top.  Both are labeled very prominently, so if you see one you'll know it.
Are those things omnidirve?  And what motors are you using?  I only see Globes.
im not particuarly for or against this topic. This is new territory in FIRST, and should be treated that way: a new and developing idea that has not had enough time yet to prove its effectiveness/diseffectiveness. It could turn out these 2 teams rule the game this year. Or, it could turn out neither do good because of a design flaw, and arent picked for finals by other teams just for the fact that they worked together (therefore cutting the work in half?) This is probably a unlikely situtation, but just for the record (this has nothing to do with this thread):

If you are in the position to pick teams for finals, pick them by who will bring the most to the table in your alliance, not their teams repuatation of being good or how much they tried selling themselves to you.
In the updates it shows that it is NOT RECOMMENDED to replace the blue wires. The reason being, is the heat it takes to solder can damage the brush housings inside the drill motor. It is advised that you can crimp/solder 10 guage wire onto the existing cables if you need extend the wire.

And please, this topic has been discussed many times, please search before you most. Thank you.


We do mentor rookie teams, and I am not saying that we do not learn from them.  However, we feel that our strengths complement each other.




I think that's where people see a problem/the controversy, Matt. The collaboration seems to have been made to increase the overall strength of both teams - teams that are already very strong and able, with a plethora of awards in their cabinets. That seems very different to me from mentoring a rookie team and providing them the necessary knowledge to make it through the build season and competition season. Based on what you said above, one scenario is to 'combine powers' (for lack of a better phrase) while the other is to teach.

> Really? Where?

Read the comic. :rolleyes: It is unedited.  The one thing that amazed me was a preverted baby that stuffed it's face in Tea's chest.  Go to your local Waldbaums or Walmart and pick up Shohen Jump. That contains five comics and they are generally all good comics.
I think the most important thing to notice on the rep points box is the choices are

I approve

or

I disapprove

it says nothing about whether you AGREE with the post or not.

A forum is a place for people to publically express their ideas and opinions, observations, and to interact with others they would not normally have access to.

If every thread started out with the first person making a comment, and everyone else chiming in that they agree - there would be no point in having the forum.

people will have differences of opinion and different ways of seeing things. I wont give anyone negative rep points unless they are rude, abusive, vulgar, or attacking someone personally.

think about the words "good repuation" and "bad reputation" when giving points - people have the right to disagree with you, if they do so in a civil manner - that should not earn them a bad reputation.

If I disagree with someones post I have sometimes given them postitive points, but put a comment in that I dont agree with them. I still approve of them making their views known, and esp appreciate someone taking a stand on a difficult subject (not that there have been any on here lately :c)

PS - scare me away? I think if my rep points went seriously negative I would conclude that I am not wanted here, and in that case, yes - I would stop posting on CD.
Not to sound critical or mean or insulting, but 123 posts in 2 days? Am I the only one that sees this as beating a dead horse? I think possibly every scenario has been covered, and no offense to anyone, but I personally don't think there's anything that needs to be said on this topic.
ya we kinda removed the blue wire and replaced it with the 10 guage wire and blew out 2 or 3 drill motors.....so that shipment of a half dozen drilll motors was nice  :yikes:
Remember people, if it's not recomended by FIRST, there's a pretty good chance they have a good reason for it :)
thats amazing =D as long as u canpick them up and shoot them back down that is a great job right there.  i know a lot of people who are ignoring the small ball part of the game will love to be alligned w/ you
They have the drill motors inside the lower section.  You can see the back of the drill motor through the holes in the gearbox.  I think I see FP motors in there as well.  /powah

maybe the 124th post will be the one that sheds light on the topic...i feel as if the discussion is going great.  if you don't like it...stop reading the thread.  don't take this as "insulting" it's very simple.  there are some people who could discuss this till the cows come home and i'm perfectly willing to let them.  besides: some of the FIRST/CD heavyweights haven't put their input in yet (whether they will or not i don't know) but i'd like to see where they stand.  final thought:  FINALLY a thread where we can have real non-bashing discussion.  it's kind of exciting. :)
who was the guy in the patent office that wanted to close it down, something like a hundred years ago, because he thought all the possible new inventions had already been thought of?

there are over 900 teams this year, with a total of how many people? 20,000? 30,000?

This is a real difficult subject here - a real can of worms. Its going to be hard for all the teams to figure out how they feel about this - and I can understand people wanting to close the door here and end the discussion.

But that will  only push the confusion and hurt feelings off the forum, where people wont be able to talk openly about them, and then they will fester until the regionals start.
Yay!  We're at 100,000 points!  That is correct.


If you do indeed want to use it to line up your robot, here's another alternative that works great. Just grab a sharpie, align it properly on a practice field, and draw a dark black line right above where the white tape is. Worked great for us last year, we never once missed the bins throughout all 3 of our competitions (gyro-based also, but proper placement was critical)



Thanks for the suggestion! It sounds like an excellent idea.
So to sum it up, FIRST doesn't want you to do it, but there is no rule that says you cannot do it.  I personally wouldn't recomend it.  FIRST reccomends that you leave at least 1.5 inches of blue wire on.
I apoligize for what I said earlier. I'm just a person that feels a topic can be discussed so many times before it starts to lose meaning. Many people on here may disagree with me about that, and they're welcome to, it's there opinions. I just want to apoligize if I offended anyone on my thread. I am sincerely sorry.

Also, this year, there is a total of 1497 teams registered. That means that given a team has 15-20 members (rough estimate), that gives us 22,455 to 29,940 give or take opinions.
Wow, I sure hoped we didn't make any of the wrong (same) assumption as 217.  I hope we can get this tested soon, but since we are mostly manufacturing everthing ourselves it has been a slow process.  Two items in Paul's post I don't understand though:  1)  The reaction force is from the Sun and ext. gear pinion and the motors which are attached to a housing and chassis.  2)  How can you have the same output torque at different speed ratios - where is the energy going?  To this second question it could go into backdriving the other motor.  But we designed the gearing so that they should output the same torque at stall.  We are also planning to connect a current sensor on the motors to detect when they are backdriven.

If it all goes bad - we do have a backup transmission ready (but it's so darn heavy!!)
Is that a previous year's robot I see in the background?  Or do you guys have more than 1?  Or did you have a scrimmage this weekend so other robots were present?  Basically....what is up with that other robot in the background?
Those Go-L computers are miserable.  Blech.

I'd like an Athlon64 3400+, a Matrox Parhelia, 3 21" Samsung Syncmasters.  It'd be nice to have no wires at all.  Wireless monitors, wireless keyboard and mouse, wireless speakers, bluetooth printer.  It'd be nice if games would span two monitors.  That'd be awesome.

I must say I'm relatively happy with my XP3000+ and radeon 9700 pro.  The only upgrades I'd really like to do is double the RAM to put a gig in it and upgrade to a 9800xt.  I won't be doing that for a while, though.
This may be oversimplified, but all you have to do is use a PWM output as a function of a joystick input. something like pwm(#)=p2_y; (or whatever port your joystick is in). U can even use the Limit_Mix function so that it reads pwm(#)=Limit_Mix(2000+p2_y);

edit: Actually if you are using a joystick, all you have to do is plug it into port2 on the OI, and ur speed controller for the globe into PWM OUT 2 and you are set to go. The y-axis controls the arm. (Default code can do wonders lol)
The second screenshot from the bottom looks really familiar. Is there something wrong with my memory, or exactly same monitor with exactly same robot in inventor image was in an animation last year?
Yes, you can use anything so long as it can be seen 100 feet away. Well you cant use tape, as the only tape we are allowed to use is with the electronics.
Or I could just buy the SMC "off the shelf" three stage solenoid...

That's what I thought too thanks :D
This is a great example of a solid working design. Great great job guys!!!
How is your drive working out? Have you had any issues w/ the 2 casters up front?
Just curious, looks great!
We haven't tryied to hang on the bar holding anything.  :)

Another update posted.  We were told that there was some trouble in opening the latest version of the database on computers running Windows 2000, ME, 97, etc.  That should be fixed and there are a few new items that we input.  If anyone really has any items they are putting on theirs, email them to us so we can put them on the master.  [email]weights@cyberblue234.com[/email]





I can't open the latest version on windows 2000 with Excel 2000. I hadn't tried any of the other ones, so I don't know if this is a new problem or not.
this is way off the subject, but who has asked first about this situation, I've searched the q+a section multiple times, but I can't find the question.  can anyone conferm that the question has actually been asked?  or are we all waiting for FIRST to take the initiative?
OK thanks.  And when we put these on the robot, We wire the motors to the victors/spikes and the victors/spikes to the RC?
Being a 13 year team, we have lots of old robots hanging around the shop.  One thing we don't have is the time or energy to build a second robot.  We're going to ship, take finals, then hit regionals the first two weekends.  Building a second robot is completely out of our sight...

We'll be heading to the UTC Scrimmage this weekend (feb 21st) to see how well the 'bot fairs in competition.
Like I said in the last post; all is not lost.  After I posted, I went to your website and looked at your Inventor picture of the transmission.  You ARE making the same assumptions as we did.  Your gear ratio from the drill motor is way too low and it will backdrive or stay at stall and trip breakers.  My biggest suggestion to you is when you are driving at slow speed, turn off the drill motor and have a way to keep the ring gear from spinning.  If you spin both motors in opposite directions, make sure the drill motor can't overrun because you will actually start driving backwards.  Your config as shown will provide a VERY fast high speed, but you need to handle the stall torque of the drill motor at slow speed.

You can e-mail me and I will give you my phone number if oyu would like to discuss it.

A nice electrical diagram put out by FIRST can really help you out a lot:
http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/2004_Power_Distribution_Diagram_rev0120704.pdf
Ours is nowhere to be seen neither and
I.
Am.
Freaking.
Out!
I thought I put it up Sunday and now it's nowhere to be seen.
This is horrible. :(
I don't think I'd choose any of those.  Mandrake and Redhat are pretty hard to really slim down to run on an older computer.  Gentoo would be really annoying as most people choose to compile it from scratch, which would take a few days for a p133 to get a working system.  I'd choose Debian or Slackware since those can be exceptionally light-weight setups.
Actually, if you follow the flow chart, you cannot use any off the shelf solenoids.

Electronics (yes) -&gt; Is the part a motor, **solenoid**, pump, or other actuator? (yes) -&gt; No, it may not be used.
As far as I know, neither team 254 nor team 60 has asked FIRST about the legality of our collaboration.  Since I would probably be the one to do that for my team, I know we have not done so.  If another team has asked, I have not heard about it.

We obviously think that we have not violated any rules in letter or spirit.  Some people disagree with us.  We'll see what FIRST officially says.
the bot looks way cool.  the fact that you are done already makes me envious :D   another question... what are you planning to do if someone hits your arm while it's down?? (I am not threatening) :ahh:
that was something our team had a huge problem with
By my calculations, you can get just one cycle in and out at 60psi.  The next one will be at greatly reduced pressure.
The Clippard tanks are 16 cu in each.  That piston should take at most 14.1 cu in for an extend, and slightly less for a retract.  thus, after one cycle, the air in the volume tanks will be at 60 psi, thanks to one of those nitfy gas laws whose name I can't remember.  P1*V1=P2*V2.  And I'm ignoring the volume of the tubes, as it is relatively negligible at this scale.

If you want to get all those shifts out of the 2 tanks, turn your regulator down to 40-45 psi.  That should get you exactly that many shifts out of your piston.


It is relatively easy to make a continuously variable transmission if you are willing to turn a percentage of your power into heat.




Or generate electricity to charge a battery - like the Toyota Prius. Incidently, it uses a planetary gear system not unlike the one shown to split the power coming from the gasoline engine and simulateously drive the wheels and charge the battery.

Bring on the hybrid robots...

Judge Judy.. hmm.. Isnt that a stupid name to have?
Thanks DJ.
So to make sure I have this all right.

The two 3/8" drill motors each go to a victor 883.  The victors connet to the circcuit breaker (same this as a fuse box?).

The two van door motors are the same as the drills- motors to victors to circuit breaker.

The two window motors each go to a spike which connects to the circuit breaker.

For the pnuematics, both the solenoid and the compressor connect to spikes.
-Are the spikes really necessary?
-Why do the solenoids we have have four wires each? Do they all connect to one spike, or do we need two spikes for each solenoid?

More questions.
-Do we need more than one circuit breaker?
-How do we connect the Circuit Breaker to the RC?
-Can the 2004 EDU RC handle all that, or do we need to connect that stuff to the old full size RC?

Hello all,

is it against the rules if you wanted to mechanically acuate the end of an air cylinder in order to create a vacuum?

that's all



I am 99% sure this is okay.  I am certain it was last year, but since we have no need for it this year, I didn't keep the info in my head.

Best I can do.

Joe J.

P.S. ... I hated myself for the above answer, so I decided to look it up...  ...processing...

couldn't find it in the rules, but according the the Q&A section (search for "vacuum") I think it IS legal:

Section:5.7.2   Status:Answered   Date Answered:1/20/2004 **Q:**It is it legal to make a mechanical device like a syringe to evacuate air out of an area so as to create a vacuum, thereby taking advantage of atmospheric pressure when attaching to balls?**A:**Yes, it is legal.
Im pretty sure the default code already has PWMs and relay outputs that are programmed to stop if certain digital input pins are pulled low by an external switch.

From the top of my head, I think relay out 8 is tied to digital input 16? intended to be used with the compressor and the pressure limit switch? - that would be a good example of how to start.
we are trying to use limit switch as interrupts... and when the arm hits the switch, it will stop moving, that's our plan :)
I'll tell you this right now.  I very rarely (if at all) give out rep.  I don't even look at rep.  It's all the way on the right side of the page, after all.  I can glance through posts without looking at any green whatsoever.  Besides, why should someone with 10 green dots be taken more seriously than someone with one green (or heck, even still on gray) when at face value, all their opinions are very valid.  In which case I'm forced to think who deserves my rep.  Does that person with 10 dots deserve it more simply because he has the 10 dots.  Maybe I should give a leg-up to the person with 1.  If it goes to the person with 10, it's a popularity thing.  If I go to the 1, it's a pity thing.  Maybe I give it to both, but that almost defeats the purpose of the system.

And then there's bad rep.  I myself have gotten bad rep based on Jeopardy questions.  How wrong is that?  If someone only adds one line to a discussion, should I give him bad rep?  I mean, he **is** adding to the discussion after all.  Should all posts under one line be judged as bad?  There may be valid opinions in that one line.  Maybe someone double posts (which is very often by accident).  Should they be penalized for that?  I don't agree with a post?  Bad rep? (I'd never give out bad rep because someone disagrees with me, but I'm sure it happens).  Someone has started flaming other users.  Should he be given bad rep?  Yes he should (sorry, just making sure you're still paying attention ;) ).  If someone pointlessly gives you bad rep, do you have the right to fire back at them (which is a dangerous thing considering a lot of people can fire a negative rep of 15 points)?

I speak my mind.  It's just who I am.  Which puts me between a rock and a hard place.  I want to get my opinion out there (i.e., speak my mind).  The problem is my opinion often differs from that of my peers (in this case, the users of CD).  I'm not afraid of bad rep, but I'd kinda like that bad rep to be justified.  Are you going to give me bad rep because I disagree with Operation Reelect- er, I mean Operation Iraqi Freedom?  Are you going to give me good rep because you're good friends with me?  Things like this have made me just disregard the entire rep system.

I'm not saying that rep is just a popularity contest, or a tool to keep political enimies (for lack of a better name) at bay.  You have no clue how tempted I was to fire a -15 bomb in the direction of the people who gave me bad rep based on Jeopardy questions.  I never did, but I wouldn't be suprised if that's another large source of bad rep.  I'm pretty sure that a lot of rep givin out is deserved either way.  But even if 90% of all rep givin out is justified (and IMO, it's probably less than that), that makes 10% of the system a popularity contest, and a way to oppress those that disagree with you.  And 10% of all the points givin out (or heck, lets count 10% of the people) is a lot of points (or people).  Again, I'm just speaking my mind.  I'll take you seriously even if you're in red.  And I won't let other people's opinions on you (in the form of rep), be them good or bad, influence how I feel about what you say.  You agree with me?  Cool.  You don't?  Maybe we can have a friendly debate on that topic.  Don't be afraid to post what's on your mind.  You'll never get bad rep from me if you do.

So, how 'bout them Red Sox?
I like the reputation system.  I think that being able to see who gave you the rep makes if very effective and stops it from becoming an abusive system (not that some people won't abuse it, but that's just reality).  I think it makes a lot of people stop and think before they dash off a harsh impulse post to something they take exception to since they know what they write will be "judged".  However, I find it hard to be that judge, so I've never given anything out but good rep, and that mostly to things that have made me laugh.

Regardless of whether you are posting in a controversial thread or not, there is always the chance someone will not be happy with what you said or how you said it.  Ken, didn't you get zinged for making a disparaging comment about Starbucks?  However, if you look at who is giving you good rep and bad rep, and the good rep is coming from the leaders of the rep pack, then you're doing something right and shouldn't be afraid of posting.  And I have to chime in and agree with Jessica, it's pretty darn peachy keen to get good rep from someone high up on the rep scale.  It's like, "Wow, Andy Baker liked that!"

It's just a rumor that I've come by most of my rep points by making fun of Dave Lavery.  :p
next question: do you have the power to the relay connected correctly, and also the control cable.


Since the line is much less "Curvy" this year, line following could be optimized to go faster than last year. HOWEVER, I would strongly recommend against that if possible. In many applications, not just FIRST I have tried line following and have not been satisfied with the results. Most of the time it is either too slow or loses the line too easily. Granted, there are applications where line following IS a very viable option, but I'm pretty sure that this is not one of them, especially since FIRST gives you the sensors and code to use the IR beacons, especially since they seem determined to make sure they are fully utilized in the future. So, of course, ultimately it is up to the individual teams, but personally, if you ask me, then it is not your best option.





I made some tests following the line, actualy, many of them. The best results came out using six sensors! Use them in V, and put them as far as you can from the robot's rotation center, keeping a distance of 6'-7' between the center sensors, so the robot can go with two or three corrections only. In 30 times we got there everytime between 7 and 8 seconds, never loosing the line. The limit is your drive system!
the signal should be flashing on and off - remember, these are pulse signals so that the two beacons can be distinguishable. you'll need to use code that like on www.kevin.org/frc to record the pulses and translate them into an actual input of whether or not the beacon is seen.
Kingman has not asked the question we also do not believe it needed to be asked. This subject has obviously never come up before so I'm sure no one has asked the question.

If someone feels it necessary to ask the question, ask FIRST the question.

90% of the work done by Kingman on the (4) robots was done by students and the mentors. Laron only helped on a small portion of the welding no machining. We also had two other machine shops in Kingman (Brackett Aircraft and I-Corp Arizona) make some parts both companies donated the time and materials and work directly with our students to help inspire them. I-Corp is a direct competitor to Laron (how is that for cooperation).

If anyone feels we are breaking the rules then ask what ever question you want neither Kingman nor the Cheesy Poofs have anything to hide. We would like to show you exactly how we did it. Even if you don't agree you may learn something, and in the process I know we can learn from you.


P1*V1=P2*V2.  And I'm ignoring the volume of the tubes, as it is relatively negligible at this scale.





The equation is right, but you forgot the accumulators are at 120psi. I'm also not sure about your volume calculations. I thought the accumulators are 2" bore x 6" long, which gives 18.8 in^3. I could be wrong, but the answer won't be terribly different if they are 16 in^3

You use 14.1 in^3 (at 60 PSI) when you actuate the cylinder. The accumulators hold 37.6 in^3 (at 120 PSI). Since you are only using the air at 60 PSI, you effectively have 75.2 in^3 of air, and when you get down to 37.6 in^3, you will only have 60 PSI. Thus, you have 37.6 in^3 of air to work and can actuate the cylinder twice. If you can regulate the cylinder to 50 PSI, you could get 3 shots.
then you would probably need a single-edge based interrupt pin to determine when the circuit goes from open to closed.
i just wonder why it had to be two profound teams collaberting... its like kicking a man when he's down. it wouldnt be so bad if you helped an under-resourced team, but another established team? cmon, a little biased eh?


Yes, you can use anything so long as it can be seen 100 feet away. Well you cant use tape, as the only tape we are allowed to use is with the electronics.



Actually, I think you can use tape.  R14 does say you can't use tape other than electrical insulation, but I think if you are making a team number, it'd fall under the Non-Functional decoration rule (R-55-R60).  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
One thing I really enjoy about this discussion is how it has really brought our two teams closer together.  a unique bond is formed when a large number of people challenging us.  Thanks!  Thanks also to those who have supported our effort to expand the meaning of FIRST's coopertition.  We appreciate your support.

You can get into arguments about 'it's there to meet a rule requirement, so its therefor functional', but I think that is not the intent of the rule.  The intent is prevent using tape as a fastner.

I would think that using tape to make the team numbers would be fine.  Make sure there is contrast. :)

You can insert a manual override option to turn the compressor "Off" whenever you want to.  You can insert a manual override option to turn the compressor "On" whenever you want to, as long as it does not disable the automatic shut-off at 120psi.  E.g. you can turn the compressor "On" at any time, through manual or autonomous means, but the existing software that turns the compressor "Off" at 120psi must always take priority over all other functions.

hehe, Jon, on a side note, you guys ready for the snow we're gonna get tonight?



snow???? That is a news flash to me.... Goes and looks on weather.com bookmarked page for local area.....Huh just flurries up here too bad.


the bot looks way cool.  the fact that you are done already makes me envious :D   another question... what are you planning to do if someone hits your arm while it's down?? (I am not threatening) :ahh:
that was something our team had a huge problem with



depending the intensity of the impact in the arm it can break... but we want to stay with the arm in the back of the bot.
But is almost impossible to not hit in a bot...so we´re taking more arms to replace  :rolleyes:
Any other question...pls post  :yikes:
aww you guys are lucky, we're getting a fair ammount starting at 3am going into tommorow afternoon :/
how exactly does it get in the database?


It would be my interpretation that is would be perfectly legal.  IMHO the preople on these forums seem to like to shun that which they have not seen before or which in not commonplace, or is not specifically specified to be legla.  Look at the intention of the rules.  Somebody at the kickoff said somethign about not being lawyers here.  Use your common sense people.  Its not all that hard.




I've not seen anything in the rules THIS year about it (I'll re-read the Tournament tonight), but last year alignment aides were specificly illegal to help place the robot.  The wooden angle and other sighting devices were not allowed, but landmarks on the robot itself were.




And It didn't directly effect the outcome of the match at all. It simply helped the drivers align with objects on the field.





It only made it easier for the driver to pick up bins, increasing the multiplier, so it didn't affect the outcome of the match?
:confused:

I think I have to disagree with Andy over the idea that all criticism should be sent through PM's.  I think we all can learn quite a bit from good criticism and there's something that we can all contribute to it.  The opportunity is lost if it's not constructive criticism.




I agree with that to an extent. We all can learn from criticism. Last year Matt Reiland of 226 (I think it was him) saved our butts because in one of our teasers we had a pneumatic cylinder held in place illegally, if it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't have realized it and it would have caused quite a bit of embarrassment if an inspector caught it at a regional or at the championship. Also, just this last week Paul Copioli from 217 pointed out a flawed assumption about a CVT design. That will probably save headaches and pain for that team because of that. Another good example of good criticism. I agree that certain criticisms should be posted, but again with everything you have to draw a line somewhere. As everyone else before me said use your head before you post it and if you are in doubt, I say go ahead and PM, if something good comes out of it or a problem is solved the team you helped will let you know. You all have them, so use your brains.
Where is everyone emailing their forms to because the one I posted on Saturday has gone missing?

Team 230, Gaelhawks - [www.shsrobotics.org](http://www.shsrobotics.org)
Hows that DeWalt chopsaw working for you?  We've had to take apart the switch on ours a few times since we got it in 2001.

Also, any plans to shield that controller?  It looks rather exposed, and they will break when they take a good hit.  :(

Otherwise, I thought that there wouldn't be enough room to pickup enough balls to be worth the effort of a hopper.  Perhaps I was wrong...

Have your primary FIRST contact enter the URL to your team's entry into the TIMS. If you view the team list for a regional you are attending and your team's name links to the website you want entered into the website competition, then you know FIRST has received the correct information.
it would be much simpler to have the line of code that is controlling the motor also look at the limit switch on a digital input pin, instead of using interrupts

this is not really an interrupt application, because you are controlling the motor output on every loop of your code anyway, there is no reason to interrupt the loop when the switch closes - the victors and spikes dont respond that fast.

besides, contact switches bounce when they open and close - which means, instead of simply going from 0 to 1, they go 0000111110011011010101111111111 - so for every switch closure you will see maybe 20 to 100 interrupts within several milliseconds.

alright, thanks, just wondering if that's all we had to do.  ^^
[www.x-cats.org](www.x-cats.org)


we are trying to use limit switch as interrupts... and when the arm hits the switch, it will stop moving, that's our plan :)



As Ken mentioned, this section from the FRC default code, user_routines.c, Default_Routine() does what you want. Each of the pwm outputs are stopped by a limit switch in either direction (min, max).


/*---------- PWM outputs Limited by Limit Switches  ------------------------*/

Limit_Switch_Max(rc_dig_in05, &pwm03);
Limit_Switch_Min(rc_dig_in06, &pwm03);

Limit_Switch_Min(rc_dig_in08, &pwm04);
Limit_Switch_Max(rc_dig_in09, &pwm09);

Those Go-L computers are miserable.  Blech.

I'd like an Athlon64 3400+, a Matrox Parhelia, 3 21" Samsung Syncmasters.  It'd be nice to have no wires at all.  Wireless monitors, wireless keyboard and mouse, wireless speakers, bluetooth printer.  It'd be nice if games would span two monitors.  That'd be awesome.

I must say I'm relatively happy with my XP3000+ and radeon 9700 pro.  The only upgrades I'd really like to do is double the RAM to put a gig in it and upgrade to a 9800xt.  I won't be doing that for a while, though.




Return to Castle Wolfenstien will give you perifial vison using three monitors with the Parhelia.  Or maybe it was some other game, but there are definatly games that will span three screens.

My XP 1800+ still putzes along just fine. :)

I had experince with the reputation system over at @Forums](http://209.123.85.43/) and I survived that so I'm not going to sweat the system here.
That being said, I still think it's nothing more than a poularity contest and a stupid one at that.
when you soldered the sensor to the wires, did you cross the wires over like it shows in the sensor drawings? if you plug them straight into a pwm cable, the wrong signals will be on the pins

if your sensor is on solid then something is wrong, you should get a pulse with a 10mS period if its seeing the beacon - BTW the beacon is very bright and bouces off walls in small rooms, people, boxes...  and covering it with your hand wont block the light. you really need to be out in a large open space to work with the IR system.
It sounds like you burned the sensor. You need to be very careful with heat around them. Always use a heat sink (an alligator clip works fine) between the soldering and the sensor, and use a low wattage soldering iron.
After reading this thread I can honestly say I'm more concerned with the unprofessinal comments coming from mentors and engineers that the actual subject matter of this discussion....You know who you are...comments like "But please stop and consider that there are a lot of us out here who do not copy everything you do, who are not following in your wake saying thankyouthankyouthankyou we could not do this without you"
Just what was this sarcastic comment trying to acheive? No one is forcing anything on any team. Run your team as you choose. Teams 254 and 60 have.  I certainly hope you have not "inspired" your students to follow with this attitude.

The comment about this collaboration resulting on students cheating on HS and college assignments.. Please, I think its an insult to FIRST students to imply they don't know difference between cheating on your homework or exams and collaborating on a project. I thought 'teamwork" is one if the building blocks of FIRST.
The comment regarding FIRST not being about making machinists and welders... Do you think these are somehow "bad" professions? Think before you post.

As for companies in the real world working together on the same product/project etc..
They do it all time. Check out www.unitedspacealliance.com. Two biggies who have obviously figured out the working together yields better results than working alone.

As for companies "going to market with the same product" and diminishing the "competitive nature". Again, think before you post. There is a whole market out there that is just this, its called generics. Generic drugs, foods, etc... And trust me, this market prompts alot of competition. But you know,this really doesn apply to this thread. The point I am tyring to make is that before you go off and say the "sky is falling" please do so in a rational, thought out manner with at least some evidence to justify yourself.
Please remember your posts here reflect on your entire team, like it or not.So think first , think again and then post.

but the existing software that turns the compressor "Off" at 120psi must always take priority over all other functions.

The 120 psi is a hardware limit - the compressor has a relief valve.  Keeping it running will not charge it above 120psi unless you modify the compressor.

More questions.
-Do we need more than one circuit breaker?
-How do we connect the Circuit Breaker to the RC?
-Can the 2004 EDU RC handle all that, or do we need to connect that stuff to the old full size RC?

Allison



You must have 1 circuit breaker per powered part.  You do not connect each circuit breaker to the RC - only one 20 amp, which is used for powering the RC.  The EDU RC, I believe, will do fine.
Isn't that actually her real name?
one great thing about the rep points system is its a great way to toss a short comment of encouragement towards someone without having to post it, or send a PM - and I think it has really cut down on the one-line "me too" posts
Is your arm controller a scale model of the arm programmed so when the model is moved the robot arm moves in the exact same way? That'd be cool.
I only get reps from one person who will remain un-named.  First he gives me two bad reps as soon as I join and start posting for stupid stuff.  He said I didn't search before I posted a new thread... How is he going to tell me I didn't search?  Was he standing over my shoulder watching me?  I searched (Chief Deplhi and FIRST Q&A) before posting so I wouldn't get a bad rep.  I sent him a message and he gave me some good rep points to make up for it, but nows hes started doing it again.  I don't really like the system.  At least make it so that people have to explain why they gave you the bad rep. so you will know what you did wrong.  Now I have to go back and try to figure it out on my own...
I like the little wings on the sides. Ball corallers, no doubt. I don't see anything that could get you up the steps or onto the bar, though. I guess that's not part of your strategy?

I would think so. One of the hints given in the manual this year with respect to the website award is that the judges will expect the site to be up-to-date (seeing a website that hasn't been updated in 2 years may not give the best impression to the judges). So, go ahead and keep updating your website and making it better. However, there will come a time that the updates you perform on your website won't count towards your teams score for a specific regional--the judges will eventually visit your site and score it. Take a look at [section 8.8](http://www.team229.org/fm/8.8) of the manual for further clarification.

> Please remember your posts here reflect on your entire team, like it or not.So think first , think again and then post.


Too many teams try to rationalize what they do by tossing up things like "we post all our designs after the season, publish white papers..." as if that somehow makes the other things they are doing ok.

FIRST teams did not invent multi speed transmissions, multi motor drive systems, or shift on the fly drivetrains - I had a shift on the fly multispeed bicycle back in 1967

The POINT I was trying to make is that, just because your team has done very well in the past, or has raised the bar, or published white papers on all the neat stuff you have used, that doesnt make it ok for you to bend the rules, or to come up with clever ways that give you an unfair advantage over other teams this year.


90% of the work done by Kingman on the (4) robots was done by students and the mentors. Laron only helped on a small portion of the welding no machining. We also had two other machine shops in Kingman (Brackett Aircraft and I-Corp Arizona) make some parts both companies donated the time and materials




This is exactly the issue of concern.  I am not concerned with how much either team contributes to the community.   I am not concerned with the motivation behind the formation of the 'Bionic Poofs' manufacturing alliance.  I am not concerned with the impact that said alliance has had on the students on these teams.  I am not concerned with the challenges associated with multi-team design and build.

I am concerned with the rules of the competition that relate directly and unambiguously to the situation described by Glenn in the quote above and in the previous posts by team 60 and team 254 members.

The rules clearly state that work done on the robot by non-team members must be billed against the $3500 limit, whether that work was donated, bought, or bartered.  The situation at hand is that roughly half of team 60's robot was built by people who are not members of team 60, and roughly half of team 254's robot was built by people who are not members of team 254.

If both teams have billed every thing according to the rules, **and** both teams' robots are not in violation of the $3500 rule (and the $400 rule), then there is no problem with what they've done.  In fact, if that is the case they've made an amazing accomplishment.

On the other hand, if they are not billing non-team labor against their $3500 budget, or if they are billing it and exceed $3500 / $400 for the robot / individual part, then they are clearly in violation of both the spirit and the letter of the rules.  I believe that their alliance affords both teams a significant competitive advangage vs. every other team that designed and built their whole robot with only the resources that their team had secured.  I believe the $3500 rule is in place to limit exactly this kind of imbalance.

The only grey area that exists with respect to the rules is the notion of one or more persons having dual team affiliation.  To my knowledge there is no provision for such dual team membership in any official FIRST document.  Likewise, I know of no official FIRST document which forbids dual team membership.  This is something that I believe should have been cleared up before kickoff, or ASAP thereafter.
Isn't her husband also a judge?


One thing I really enjoy about this discussion is how it has really brought our two teams closer together. a unique bond is formed when a large number of people attack us. Thanks! Thanks also to those who have supported our effort to expand the meaning of FIRST's coopertition. We appreciate your support.


I haven't seen any posts 'attacking' either of your teams, persay. In fact, I think the posts have been, for the most part, good-natured. You shouldn't label a post as an 'attack' because it may express an opposing viewpoint. You should embrace the criticism. And to all of the people complaining that this thread should be closed: If every controversial thread were closed, this forum would be downright boring. Until there's a blatant insult towards either of the teams involved, or any other team, for that matter, I see no reason to shut this one down.
If another robot runs  into it, will the arm slide off the bar?

Reputation points don't really bother me.  This is mostly because I've been posting on here since the old forums (no, the old, old forums; the ones Brandon wrote).  It is, however, interesting to see who has reputation and who doesn't.  For some people, reputation is highly deserved.  I'm not so convinced that others deserve the reputation they have.  Either way, it can (doesn't mean it will, just that it can) start to approximate a popularity contest and I'm wary of those to begin with.

Thanks DJ.
So to make sure I have this all right.

The two 3/8" drill motors each go to a victor 883.  The victors connet to the circcuit breaker (same this as a fuse box?).

The two van door motors are the same as the drills- motors to victors to circuit breaker.

The two window motors each go to a spike which connects to the circuit breaker.

For the pnuematics, both the solenoid and the compressor connect to spikes.
-Are the spikes really necessary?
-Why do the solenoids we have have four wires each? Do they all connect to one spike, or do we need two spikes for each solenoid?

More questions.
-Do we need more than one circuit breaker?
-How do we connect the Circuit Breaker to the RC?
-Can the 2004 EDU RC handle all that, or do we need to connect that stuff to the old full size RC?

Allison



Not to be pedantic but you can't use Victor 883's.  You need to use Victor 884's (which have been available for the last two years).

As for the spikes connected to the pneumatics, yes they are necessary.  Without the spikes it would be impossible to switch the compressor and the solenoids on and off.

You most definitely need more than one circuit breaker.  Each Victor gets placed on its own circuit breaker.  If the Victor is driving a drill motor or a CIM motor, it should be attached to one of the 40 amp circuit breakers.  For any of the other motors, it should be attached to a 30 amp circuit breaker.  The spikes which drive motors are connected to 30 amp circuit breakers while the spikes connected to solonoids are connected to a 20 amp breaker.  The robot controller is a 20 amp breaker.

To connect a circuit breaker to the RC, you need to put the circuit breaker in series with the positive power terminal for the RC.

You need to use the full size RC on this year's robot.  You can't use the EDU RC.

No offense, John.
Just mentioning a process is being made.
We'll be looking you up next year when you guys come up to Rochester in 2005 (you are comming, right?).



John claimed 229 would be there when I talked to him about it.  He also offered his services as a head ref but I figured it was a bit too soon to commit.

hmm... are you planning on dumping into you ball chute or OOB?
How many of you have played with Windows NT on an Alpha? They were amongst the most amazing systems ever. I had the chance to play with one for a while, and very few systems I have seen were as responsive as that one.

Personally, I am very happy with my current system, while its not a "dream" system. Those who know much of computers will be amused, as it is a Pentium 166MHz, mmx system, 64mb of pc66, and 19.2gb of disk space. And did I mention the Radeon 7500 and the SB Audigy? =)

It works for what I use it for - and can even run Inventor and Jedi Knight at reasonable speed. But it is not an Alpha, which would qualify as a dream system.
I met John Just over four years ago when I first joined 151. Since then I have learned so many things from him I have lost count. When were having an argument on which way would be better to do soemthing, John would come up with some easier that both sides would agree on. He is an amazing engineer and and amazing leader. I am extrememly glad that he has been given this award and I wish him nothing but but good on his future endavors.

Congrats John on winning UFH.

well, most of the code is contained in tracker.c and navigate.c - there shouldn't be too many modifications.

first, navigate uses pwms 3 and 4, whereas the default code uses 1 and 2 - you'll need to reconcile this.

second, the call to navigate should go in User_Autonomous_Code.
I've reuploaded the file again.  It is being saved as a Microsoft Excel 97-2002 & 5.0/95 Workbook.  That should work.  If it isn't, I'm not exactly sure why this isn't working so please let me know if you have any idea on how to fix the problem.  Thanks.

there's another reason why it may be leaking, when you have the black gasket and you are assembling the solenoid make sure that the a side lines up with a and b with b. there are little letters that help you to line them up, we had ours hooked up backwards and when we reset it it stopped leaking


I tested the relays with the multimeter - when I set relay1_fwd to 1, the spike turns red and the multimeter reads -12v.  When relay1_rev is 1, it's green and the multimeter reads 12v.  This seems backwards to me...




I also checked a relay with a multimeter today (as I said I would last night) and came the to the same conclusion as steven114.  With relay5_fwd set to 1  (relay5_rev = 0 and LED was red), the multimeter common probe on the M- of the spike connected to relay output 5, and the multimeter voltage postive probe connected to M+, the multimeter read -12V.  The relay output cable was connected correctly.  I also checked the same spike with the common probe on ground.  I read 12v on the M- and 0v on the M+.   It seems that the IFI aliases are incorrect.

I was wrong about this and my sincere apology to anyone I may have confused.  My knowledge of the matter was based on a false assumption.  The single solenoid I was basing this on was wired to the M- of the Spike.  It was the only one of our 5 solenoids (2 double, 3 single) wired without an external ground (it has been rewired now).

I have rewritten ifi_aliases.h to change the aliases from fwd to rev and visa versa.  I loaded the modified program into my bot and confirmed that relay 5 (my compresser) was getting +12V.  A zip file with my new ifi_aliases.h file is attached to this post.  Hope it helps.  I am posting from MOE HQ workshop (not my dorm as usual) so I have get back to work now.  Once again I'm sorry.<br><br><a class='attachment' href='/uploads/default/original/3X/8/a/8aa49fce9415ed07ad14da552075c89938a132ec.zip'>ifi_aliases.zip</a> (2.56 KB)<br><br><br><a class='attachment' href='/uploads/default/original/3X/8/a/8aa49fce9415ed07ad14da552075c89938a132ec.zip'>ifi_aliases.zip</a> (2.56 KB)<br>
Maybe it's just me, but I think that the negativity is due (in a very LARGE part) to the end of the season rush.  Even though I love being involved in FIRST, there have been a few times this week that I've wished that I had the entire week to myself...a chance to relax, instead of rushing to finish a project.  As a result of that, I've been a bit irritable at times, especially when I realize just how much work is left for us to do.  I know I'm not the only one that's in this boat, and that might be part of where the negativity has stemmed from.

Then again, that's just my two cents...
how sturdy is it while hanging, it looks vulnereable how it looks in the pic


where are you located? i might be able to mail your our extra from last year.

they defently came in the kit though, they are very small so keep one of the new guys looking.





we are using two of them so we would need 4 of the connectors.

We're in Irvine California and we'd pay for shipping and might be able to give you something in return?  :yikes: ?

Thanks for the offer
Those are just beautiful. :-)
I think you look at this as though it was easy, it wasn’t it was difficult. If we were to do this again next year we have several “lessons learn” to improve our process.

Our hope is that we can show what we did and how we did it to any team that is interested. If other team uses some of our methods they will improve the process and more people that get involved the better we will all are at competing in this game.

I can’t see it working for more than two to three teams in a group given the obstacles to over come. Most teams will not be able to make a process like this work at all and will be more successful on their own. Others may improve there program by new innovative systems such as this.

When I say game I don’t just mean Regionals or Nationals I mean the whole process. We are learning about Free Enterprise. We have to market ourselves to gain sponsorship and raise money, we have to share our wealth with other team to inspire them to grow there business. We have to find designers, machinists, welders, and painters, truckers, and so on to help us complete or task.

No matter what each year each team should do everything it can to make there program stronger and every year we will all be a little better than the year before. Most of the rookie teams are starting off better than we did when we were a rookie because we can give them more tools to work with than there we just a few years ago.

How do we finance, design, manufacture, and ship this product in six weeks? How do we make ourselves as competitive as we can be? We innovate and we learn new ways of doing business. FIRST students have the advantage of learning this years before there time. Some people never learn this in a lifetime and others only years after they are out of school.

This years game is tough, and the game will be won by the best alliance not the best robot. In my opinion the robot design only equates to 25% of the winning alliance. The other 75% rests with the alliances themselves, strategy, and luck.

We are talking about two teams with nearly identical robots out of 900 plus teams do you really think this is going to turn the FIRST world upside down? Do you think this really gives us an unfair advantage?
Butzin first off, say all your base are belong to anything EVER again, and I'm gonna callibrate you. Secondly, your fired. Third try this: defaultSave = /dev/null

sexy kinda, although i wouldnt go out w/ it...does that sound bad? lol NICE JOB!
use a peice of PVC pipe as a tensioner...run a bolt through it and bolt it to the frame
Can I just say that that bot is the most awesome piece of machinery ever seen yet. There are so many words to describe it, some very descriptive others quite 'colorful'. Question: Which regional(s) is your team going to? I'd love to see the thing in person.
lol, now if some robots could be that awesome looking ;) lol


p.s. that was meant to be a joke, dont take it litterally
Heh, that reminds me of the lexan control box we made for the 2002 season. It wasn't fun trying to get that thing on an airplane, let me tell you.

This year?  No.  Future years?  Absolutely.  If this practice is allowed to continue unrestricted, the FIRST Robotics Competition could change dramatically (for the worse, IMHO).



Do you think this really gives us an unfair advantage?



Yes, if it has allowed circumvention of the $3500/$400 limit,  I do.
The scars on those wedge plates just scream, "Stack Attack"
See photo gallery Dale(engr] 2004 robots 2-17,
IR hooded receivers top/bottom (in sockets)

Use of PWM cable requires the Red & Black pins reversed prior to soldering.

For test purposes
construct a special male to male PWM cable
and plug-in the receivers in to test.
I use a PWM "Y" insert
with the 2nd male end flared for observation with the scope probe & gnd.

(a current limited +5v power supply may be substituted for the DIG IN side
power (red/black) set to ~.05A, receivers need ~5mA .005A
for bullet proof protection while testing)

The Vishay 34840 & 4840 receivers do not respond to continuous (DC) IR.

The IR Beacon must pulse at 40kHz +-~2kHz, (50-50 duty cycle).

The receiver very selectively accepts only 40 kHz on=off pulsed IR,
rejecting  less than ~38kHz or greater than ~42kHz or continuous IR (DC)

Correct Pulses are provided by the EDU controller with Beacon code running.

The best way to observe proper Receiver operation is with an **oscilloscope.**
see photo gallery Dale(engr] 2004 Beacon scope waveforms

Probe the 4840 Output pin:
with no pulsed IR present, voltage level is a constant +5vDC,

when 40 kHz is detected, level is 0v (ground) for 1 ms or 2 ms
"this is called active LOW" and what we look for in the code

then back high for the remainder of the period - 9mS or 8 ms,

The cycle repeates every 10mS (100Hz)

The scope is also a good way to view fidelity of the IR signal.
Reflections/weakness often show up as shorter irratic and/or dropout pulses.

Observe care to avoid:
Output pin to +5v shorts when 40kHz IR is active
as this may damage them (we have 3 dead)

(see previous post: the output voltage never goes below ~2.5v

In this fault there is a negative going pulse upon detection, but it's
truncated, i.e. stops short of 0V.
The DIG INP requires the voltage level to go
less than ~.5V [TBD] to signal IR pulses detected.)

Note that a DMM does not give a clear 0V reading in the presence of pulsed IR
due to the short duty cycle, the average is close to +5v (= no IR state)
but a small but discernable decrease from 5v can be seen.

(even with a strong signal the output Voltage is high (+5V)
90% (2ms) to 95% (1ms) of the cycle)
I agree, and I highly doubt that plumber's wrench is part of the design process :)

I thought I put it up Sunday and now it's nowhere to be seen.
This is horrible. :(




Ed, take a deep breath. If you know you uploaded is on Sunday, then you did.  Again, I speculate Autodesk is removing forms off Steamline to make more room for teams since the folder was full at one point. Check the folder that's for submitting your final animation and see if your team number is there.  If not, I would suggset e-mailing autodesk and asking them if they are removing forms to make room.  If other FIRST-ers are deleting them, that's an incredibly ungracious move by them... but we can't be held accountable for others' actions.  If you uploaded your form, you shouldn't be liable from that point on.
I just wanted to chime in on this subject one last time.

I suppose the thing that upsets me most about this thread is not the fact that people disagree or even disapprove of what our two teams have accomplished this season, but more so having to once again witness the obvious double standards that exist not only in the world of FIRST, but in the world in general.

It seems we are allowed to help teams that we know we can beat or that pose no threat to the other “powerhouse teams”. I have seen this time and again, teams are willing to help out the rookies or even other veteran teams that seem to be struggling. But very few are willing to extend help to another team of equal “powerhouse” caliber. I’m not saying that none will (in fact both 25 and 79 have helped us with quite a bit with our drive train research), but it certainly isn’t given as freely as it is to those that struggle. Mind you, I’m not saying that we should stop helping rookies and start building monsters, what I mean to say is that there are plenty of opportunities to help everyone.

I have seen numerous posts chastising our two teams because we could have used our resources to help out some rookie teams rather than each other. I would like to again point out the fact that both of our teams do mentor rookie teams. In fact our team has helped to start FIRST programs in several states in which FIRST did not even exist.

Additionally, between the two of us we provided 100% of the machine shop support at 3-4 regionals last year (not sure if Kingman did one or two) and provided additional support at Nationals (Texas is a long way to drag a trailer from California!). When you consider this, bare in mind that at that time we were in no way obligated to share our resources. FIRST has recently changed the rules (perhaps because we lead the way in that respect as well) so that now if a team wants to bring their own mobile machine shop they have to support other teams. I think this is a wonderful rule, and I’m sure you will see many teams doing just that this year. However we did it because we wanted to, not because we had to. In fact this year we will be providing machine shop support not only at the two regionals we will be attending, but also for at least one regional at which we are not even registered.

I would also like to point out that we are not teams of unlimited resources! Our team came from very humble beginnings (please feel free to research it it’s a great story!), and presently we have only one actual engineer and two engineering students (I list my team role as engineer because it best describes what I do for our team, although I won’t receive my degree until this May). Kingman has zero engineers and a couple of machinists (albeit darn good ones). As such our combined resources are much less than those of many of the teams we compete with, but we still find a way to help literally hundreds of teams.

During this past year our two teams tried something new. Our initial intent was not to build identical robots, that just kind of happened. Our intent was simply to build the best robots we could, to give our kids the best experience we could along the way, and hopefully to blaze a trail into a new and undiscovered world of FIRST where everyone helps everyone. If you find some flaws in our first attempt please don’t hold that against us, our intensions were as noble as could be.

I still feel that collaboration is a good thing; the sharing of ideas and resources is always a good thing. I am also sure that our teams will continue to work together in the future and I hope others do the same. We’ve already been down the road where the veteran teams help the new teams all the while guarding their best secrets to maintain an edge. Let’s turn the corner and see what lies down this new road where there are no secrets. Where everyone shares everything willingly and gives aid to others without bias. We are trying to turn that corner and yes there may be a few bumps, but never the less we still want to find out where the road goes.

And to those of you who find fault with this, you have every right to question our actions, but please don’t question our motives.

I have to go now we have a robot to build.

Good luck to all,


Dennis Jenks
I will confirm, this Americanized version of the Shonen Jump is not half bad... it has Sandman and the best manga of all time - One Piece.  Yu Yu Hakusho isn't bad either.  It just kinda makes me mad that they used the title "Shonen Jump" from the original title in Japan, which isn't really anything like this American book o' Manga.


..."ya think he's compensating for something?"




Try "Oh my...."  ;)
I would just like to point out that few posts have said anything negative about 254 or 60.  We do not question your teams' contribution towards FIRST.  However, this concept of collaboration is new to us.  You guys have had a much longer time to think this through.  We are only questioning the idea, not your team's integrity.  Please don't mistake an attack on the idea as an attack on your team.  Besides, few of us are concerned with what you did.  We're concerned with what other teams may do with the idea you have presented.  Personally, I'm glad you opened this "can of worms."  That doesn't mean I fully agree with what it may lead to.


I've reuploaded the file again.  It is being saved as a Microsoft Excel 97-2002 & 5.0/95 Workbook.  That should work.  If it isn't, I'm not exactly sure why this isn't working so please let me know if you have any idea on how to fix the problem.





Still won't open for me. However, I was able to open it in gnumeric on linux, so it must be triggering some type of odd bug in excel or windows.


Not to be pedantic but you can't use Victor 883's.  You need to use Victor 884's (which have been available for the last two years).

As for the spikes connected to the pneumatics, yes they are necessary.  Without the spikes it would be impossible to switch the compressor and the solenoids on and off.

You most definitely need more than one circuit breaker.  Each Victor gets placed on its own circuit breaker.  If the Victor is driving a drill motor or a CIM motor, it should be attached to one of the 40 amp circuit breakers.  For any of the other motors, it should be attached to a 30 amp circuit breaker.  The spikes which drive motors are connected to 30 amp circuit breakers while the spikes connected to solonoids are connected to a 20 amp breaker.  The robot controller is a 20 amp breaker.

To connect a circuit breaker to the RC, you need to put the circuit breaker in series with the positive power terminal for the RC.

You need to use the full size RC on this year's robot.  You can't use the EDU RC.

We're not officialy competing because we couldn't get our registration fee, but we decided to build a robot for practice, because we plan to compete in '05.  Well actually, It's not just for practice, but we haven't released other plans for it yet, because they're not all ready.  OUr drill motors are the old 3/8" ones, so we were going to use the Victor 883's because we were kinda hoping that there might be another team that could lend them to us, because we can't afford them.  Also, we have and old Full Size RC, but we're using the EDU one  for most stuff (we're using the Full Size for the OI and the EDU for everything else) because it would be a waste of time for our programmer to learn P-basic for the Full Size RC.  Thanks for your help.

As in reputation i have gotten many good ones for this thread and i did not intend this thread to do  that i just wanted to bring this up cause it bothers me and i got a negative rep for this thread which said

"Learn to proofread. If you could post sentences that made since, then people would not negative rep you"

I mean this is a reason i dont like to post it feels so good to get good reputation because it shows that someone is getting somethign out of what you post, but i mean when something like this comes along it makes me want to stop.  I do not  really pay attention to gramatical errors i mean sure i try to put periods were they belong. I do not excel in english that is not my strong point but thats the reason i am in FIRST is cause i enjoy science and generally understand it and LOVE TO BUILD STUFF. I really dont care about my reputation but to get negative just because maybe i misspell somethign is stupid, it should be on the content of the post


I agree with that to an extent. We all can learn from criticism. Last year Matt Reiland of 226 (I think it was him) saved our butts because in one of our teasers we had a pneumatic cylinder held in place illegally, if it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't have realized it and it would have caused quite a bit of embarrassment if an inspector caught it at a regional or at the championship. Also, just this last week Paul Copioli from 217 pointed out a flawed assumption about a CVT design. That will probably save headaches and pain for that team because of that. Another good example of good criticism. I agree that certain criticisms should be posted, but again with everything you have to draw a line somewhere. As everyone else before me said use your head before you post it and if you are in doubt, I say go ahead and PM, if something good comes out of it or a problem is solved the team you helped will let you know. You all have them, so use your brains.




In cases where criticism is needed, it is important to post it to the thread and not PM for everyone can realize the design flaw and learn from it.  Teams that robot get criticized in a positive manner appreciate it more than they are embarassed by the bad assumption they made.  Just be careful with everything you post.  It is easy to not sometimes but posting positive criticism helps everyone reading that thread.

What is "Entire Metal Box"?
I find it amusing that team members from 60 and 254 continue to skirt the main flaw in the collaboration.

I applaud your community spirit, your outreach effort, your philanthropic endeavours, your hard work, and I appreciate the learning journey that each team experienced.  But I think you're changing the subject because you're uncomfortable with confronting the reality of the rules.

C'mon now.....Give us a straight answer.  The rules require that the robot must be designed AND BUILT by members of your team.  Otherwise, the contracted work MUST be valued per the rules and be within the $3,500 limit.

How are you going to address this graciously and professionally???

i totally agree . you guys have already  made the robots now its time to stop beatin around the bush and get down into seeing if this is legal

I personally think they will allow it htis year but next year be very clear in the rules about teams and calboration
Rule 5.3.2.2 make it clear:
Build your own robot and robot parts. If you're not going to build your own, or are unable to, and none of your sponsors is going to build them, you need to have that maching cost go on the bill of materials.

It's been said that 90% of these parts were made by students or engineers, not the mutual machining sponsor.

The way it's written, (and assuming equal distribution), 45% of the parts on each robot need to be billed out.

Last year, we had Truck Town Thunder generously volunteer to fabricate two large pieces on our robot that took 6 or 7 hours to machine each. They didn't charge us, but we billed out each of those pieces at $50 an hour, for a total of $700 against our $3,500. It's the way the cookies crumbled.

Glen and Dennis and many other team members have mentioned time and time again all of the sincerely wonderful services these teams provide for ALL teams in FIRST. You speak of the noble intentions you had with this new idea. They said that students have learned a lot more than they would otherwise. This is wonderful and greatly appreciated. Honestly. **I, for one, have NO doubts about your good intentions**.

But intentions are mutually exclusive to the rules of the game.

This is **OBVIOUSLY** a grey area. Pick the shade of grey you like, but this is something that's revolutionary and pushing the envelope. It's not written in the rules. There will be a ruling by FIRST on this.

If you're trying to convince everyone on this board that the rules are **100% **clear on this sort of colaboration and that a special ruling won't be needed, you're just kidding yourself.

*Someone should have asked FIRST for clarity before this was done (not after) and I don't think it's fair to the individuals in FIRST to put them in this sort of a bind.*

However, the situation is already at hand. If we want to keep this discussion worthwhile, let's put the facts (rules) before us about it. Personal attacks, sincerity of intentions, and the fact that the manufacturing has already occured should have no bearing on the rules.

**There's a few issues at hand:**
**1.** Can one student be a member of two or more teams?
**2.** How should this billing situation (if needed) be resolved?
**3.** What's the defintion a sponsor?

Let's keep to those and other related topics.

Good luck everybody,

Matt
Look for an SMC distributor near you.  That would probably be fastest. They can tel yu the part number you need ad get it to you quick.
Yeah, my forms aren't up there either and I posted them Friday all filled out (I checked them over like 20 times to make sure nothing got missed) I've e-mailed their support e-mail before and never had any response.
To quickly address something in your post ..

I may see how hard it is to put a hack in vB3 to disallow reputation in certain forums.  (game forum, chit chat(?), etc..)  I'm not sure if this will solve anything, though .. any comments?


I was working on the IR's and came up with a couple of questions that i need help with!!! The first thing that i have to ask is that when i had a sensor working, the signal on dashboard viewer was not solid it would either flash on and off or it would just be solid off! I don't think this should be happening so could you give me a hand.
The second thing is that I soldered one of these vishay sensors to a pwm cable and then the sensor imput was solid green no matter where the sensor was facing, covered or not.
How are other teams attaching thier sensors to the controller?? I tried a pwm cable that i took of the male end and I soldered the wire to the pins of the connector, and the problem I had was the imput always on (possibly from the heat!)
Can anyone tell me how they are attaching thier sensors and any other help on these sensors would be appreciated!!!

> **Q:** If high school students on my team make parts for another team, does the team receiving the parts need to bill out our high school students at a typical labor rate as part of the $3,500 limit?
Yea this is annoying...i spent a lot of time trying to post them yesterday and i believe the server went down...but its a holiday so tech support is gone...so we sent autodesk and email and were FINALLY able to post it today.  i really hope that they dont disqualify us on a stupid thing like that...i mean how un-FIRST like is that?
Have the teams kept accurate logs of labor hours should these hours be included?
Another solution that does not involve changing you robot dimensions or wheels is to place more wieight on either the front or rear wheels. If either end has more weight than the other, you will be able to turn easier because the heavy end will have more traction than the light end, and will be able to slide the light wheels around the corner.
I really doubt that it was someone who was just being malicious, I think they'd find it odd if only one team had an entry form. They pulled down all of the forms that were posted previous to Sunday, so that makes me think they cleared house and dumped them somewhere offline. They really need to lock the files once they are uploaded.
My MX700 batteries last for over 24 hours of normal use.  I also have dozens of other recharable double-a batteries floating around and a spare wireless mouse that can use the MX700's base station receiver.  I'm am so well-prepared :D

I don't really see how the reputation system benefits us. Sure, it helps to discern who is helpful around here, but that should be fairly evident anyway. Also, I haven't seen anyone with a negative reputation, so it seems to be less of a matter of who has *more* reputation rather than who has good reputation. This pretty much boils down to who posts more and has more of an opportunity to have their posts seen and appreciated.

However, my feelings on the reputation system's existence are fairly neutral. I don't care that it's there, nor would I care much if it was to be eliminated.
I found this also.  What does it really mean???  I'll let the debate continue.
I personlly think this is a very important discussion to have.  The outcome will forever change the face of FIRST (IMHO).

A: A team member is one that is afforded all of the rights and priveleges of all team members, including being listed in your literature and on your tee shirts (we encourage teams with large memberships).

how did you make those wheels. OR did you buy them?
here's a corrected version of the schematic. Our skilled engineers (students) actually got working on our pnuematics board. includes relief valves to prevent overpressures on the exhaust side.

Some joker labeled the actual part **DeSqoq**. Let's hope that doesn't turn out to be more accurate than **qoqDeS**...




Who are you calling joker? lol. ;) I'm glad that Alan has taught me so much about "labeling!"
It is 16 cu in for each tank..I read that in the manual kit of parts.  As for acuation.  The easiest answer is not to rely on equations and just test it.
Brandon ya it sounds good to try to take it out of certain forums but dont kill yourself

And like i said again its not that big of deal to me. I mean i do not like seeing negative rep.

I just get excited when i see liek good repuataion from people like any of the kens,Andy baker, dave lavery and countless other ones. I mean i am 17 years old i turn 18 in less then a month. I have just started touching the engineering outlook. These guys i have name have been in engineering for years. ONE EVEN WORKS ON THE ROBOT ON MARS! To get one of your post or threads noticed by these guys is amazing. When i see a good rep from them its just something that gets me excited about robotics even more. I think everyone can agree with me when you get a good rep from them it feels good because they are the leaders, mentors and people that have changed our lives in many ways.
The sun only shines as long as you believe that it does. Be happy, as long as you keep your hopes up and never give up its all good. Youll get somehting out of this experience, even if it isn't what you expect to get out of it. If you need any help you can call teams around your area. In SoCal teams are always on the phone with each other and mentors going back and forth. Your team isn't alone, you have the whole FIRST community on your side.
*please don't give me anything negative for this one!*

I am a little lost also on the reputation system. I posted a simple response on the "What are you listening to..?" thread, and suddenly, someone gives me a negative point for saying the title and artist. Nothing provacative. Why is this?

We are using pneumatic go-kart racing slicks again this year but upgrading to 12".  If you are looking for traction these are superior.  If you are looking to not cry when you put your robot on a scale find another source.  They weigh like six pounds each.  And we are using four in a four wheel drive skid steer setup.  No one is pushing us off a six inch step...Unless we do it to ourselves. Lol.
Quickest way is to lose some traction from one end or the other.  Any chance at resurfacing one set of wheels with something slipprier?  Possibly the edge profile is very square and sharp, and will snag more than slide when you are trying to pivot sideways.  If you can bevel one or both sets of wheels to a more rounded profile it could help.  We did the 2:1 gearbox last year and had to combine one pair of the sticky pneumatic Skyway wheels with one pair of the (slipprier) Polyurethane wheels, but it was still very difficult to turn with about an 18 inch wheelbase.  It required a different driving style.  Sometimes we had to actually reverse one side while driving forward on the other in order to get it to turn.  I couldn't get it to turn well while driving normally, but some could do it while another sat on top...on pavement!

Beautiful craftsmanship on your robot, by the way.  Love it!
I have tried to get the servo working.

Our code is set up so when i plug  in pwms for motors they run. i inserted the servo code as a motor. pwm03 is the servo:

pwm03 = 200;


the servo is plugged in to the  output 3 but does not move. i read the forums, and i see that they only run off the backup battery. is this true?
Just in case you haven't seen it stickied to the top, you might all want to read [this](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25464).   I was a little dismayed at the direction this thread was going a few pages back.  Fortunately, things seem to be on the upswing again, and for that I thank the people who have been reasonable and rational, no matter which position they take in this discussion.  To those that have not, just know that we're watching.  It would be a shame to end a discussion of such gravity simply because a few people can't refrain from speaking without thinking first.
Okay.

Time to step back, and take a break.

This thread was originally very constructive, but it is rapidly turning into a mob with pitchforks.

Brandon -- I am locking this thread for a few hours.  To be reopened at your discretion.

Everyone needs to cool down, on both sides.

I won't stand by and see these 2 teams who are "pillars of FIRST" that I happen to know and greatly respect be torn apart... regardless of whether their actions are right or wrong (I'm not passing judgement), we need to keep in mind that these teams are definitely the "right stuff" and have had great positive impacts on FIRST itself, and certainly on thier students.

We may decide their actions are wrong.  We may hear from FIRST that this is illegal.  We may condemn them for their actions... but... we won't attack these two teams, and their members.

Chew on that for a while... then try for some more rational discussion.

Most of the neons that ahve found their way into the computer mod sector, are made by the same companies as their automotive counterparts.  Many are identical with the exception of the connector on the end.

Personally I don't follow the rep points too much. It is nice to read the ones you got and to realize you helped someone or some team and that you had made a difference. I also rarely give out reputation and when I do it's because I feel the person has significantly helped me, my team, and/or the entire CD community in general. To date I have never given out negative rep.

It's been said in previous posts and I'll say it again, no matter what you do not everyone will agree with you and you MUST respect that. The same goes for YOU not agreeing with everyone else.
I think reputations points will allow new/inexperienced delphi users to find the information they need from good sources. They can see someone has a good reputation so obviously their opinion on fixing a problem is more valued, because they are known for good advice. On thing that should be changed is that if you give negative reputation points it should be required you leave a comment as to why you feel the person deserved it. That way the person recieving negative points can fix what the problem is in future posts. This will also discourage users from abusing the point system.

What makes you think you don't surprise us anymore?


helical.. hmm.. looks like its only attached to one wheel also.. so either you guys have the other wheel geared down to match the front or possibly- yes, thats gotta be it, you have the same drivetrain as last year?

Hybrid robots?  What's the hybrid part of it? Electical and Electrical?

First of all, I do not think you will actually be able to charge your battery by any significant amount, if at all.

Motor D: Drive Motor
Motor G: Generator Effect

Motor D has 2 places where it's torque is being used.  Motor G and the wheel(s) it is powering.  Each provides a different load on the motor.  The motor can only provide x output, whereas power to G + Wheels = D output.  Also, for D to power G, D must have an input power source (from the battery).


|BATT|--RES-- M ]--***--[Wheel]
|                 |
------RES------- G ]


The circuit would look something like this.  RES being electrical resistances, *** is Resistance from friction within the gearbox (although relativly low).   The loads upon M are outward from that.  Anywho..  the turning of G is a load on M, so any electrical force created from G will be less than what is given to M.  So the Net electricity used will be lower.  BUT...  to have equal output to the wheel, (as if G was not attached) more current must be supplied to M.

All in all..  we don't have the tools for perpetual motion.

In the hybrid cars, inertial force is used to generate electricity as well as the gas motor, which is not driven by the electrical motor.

First stated to save weight, you may remove some of the fuse panels on the maxi panel breaker, they each connect by 2 or 4 screws on the bottom side.  At competition, you should always have your removed panels for replacment.




Those (copper? Brass?) things in the fues block are HEAVY!

If you seeo ur other pics, you will notice that we are using 2x drill and 0x CIM this year, and so we took them out.  We also found out that running the black wires through the empty slots in the fuseblock was the most elegant and shortest way to do it . . . a win-win, especially since its legal.

About those program/tether ports: the wires are near enough the board that we can get to them, and they are on the side which makes access really really easy.

About the switch: I don't know why there isn't a hole over it now.  There will be soon.

It didn't **directly** effect the outcome of a match. The laser pointer didn't stack bins and protect them.
But it doesn't matter anyway, we never used it.
I was just saying that be did in fact get through inspection ok with it. It was determined to be legal.
I agree that you should check with FIRST first to make sure it's ok this year.
But if it's just for alignment, I also agree that you don't need a light. Just something to line up on the line with.
what you actually need to do is define the macro "_SIMULATOR" - hence the #ifndef lines around that particular loop. there are certain parts of the code that will get stuck without that macro defined. just go into the mplab project settings window and look for where you can define preprocessor macros, and add _SIMULATOR to the list.

yes...charging the battery we'll leave to the charger....the only time the chip motor would generate energy is when its being backdriven by the drill motor...but w/ current sensors that shouldn't happen...the second it starts to backdrive it will lower the drills speed and up the chips...we'll also keep the amt of power going to the chip a bit higher than drill (although we might not be able to go full speed from a stand still!)

Good sources?  I think just about everyone on here is a good source.  If they don't know - than they probally won't post.  If they do post something - i have only seen good.

I don't really care for the points.  I guess they are more or less a quest for attention.  I am pretty neutral about mine.  Points are kinda pointless to me - i have been here since before vB - so i could see them go or stay...

Personally, the rep system amuses me. I look at my list and say - "Lol! That person needs to chill." I deserve some of the negative rep I've gotten but some are just ludicrous (and thus highly amusing). I just sent an IM to Brandon to reinstate some rep because someone removed some points because I posted in a chit-chat thread (Dream Computer) that was a year old(Reason: "sorry..old thread..."). I've also GOTTEN points for posting in Word Association. I've also lost some because I posted my opinions in the "Music" thread (I don't care if you disagree with my tastes - DEAL WITH IT). Lol &lt;-- All I can say.
Ok, some updates (and a shameless bump, though I do hate double-posting)

We have a sprocket drilled out to fit our turret shaft.  The big (3") hole visible in the motor plate is for a FP motor, and the sprocket will fit inside the robot on the big pole, and be driven by the FP motor.  thus we can turn our arm around and around.  More difficult to build, but it should be awesome to have the driver park the both and let the arm operator do his thing, without all the inefficiencies that happen in less-thatn-perectly trained teams.

Driving is becoming harder with the arm, but it is still much faster and handels much better than our 2003 robot.  It requires experience, though. The dedicated freshman can tip it over while driving, although all of us were putting it through a stress test and he is the only one who almost made it flip.  Inexperienced as he was, he reacted fast enough to save it.  Maybe he has potential as a driver, but not this year.  If it goes over without something else causing it, its our driver's fault.  Hopefully we will get one smart enough to know whats what.  Turning with the marbles is great, although we may look into non-glass replacements.  Its gotta be something with balls, though, its just too funny of an idea.  Back to the point of this paragraph: as of now the controls for the arm aren't finished, so the arm is unpowered when we drive.  Therefore it has a tendency to flop around some, especially the rotating (turret) part of is which is not connected to a motor, so if the driver makes the wrong move, the arm freewheels around the robot.  No major problems, but its something we are keeping an eye on.

The claw is marching steadily towards completetiong (especially because we still have 9 days till ship!) and I don't think there will be a problem with that, but then I did design it and I am building it, so I may not be that objective.  Everything works so far.

I hope to get some more time with that hand-grinder soon and do that finish.  Its ridiculously cool.  I hung that one sample peice from the ceiling of our room with a few zip-ties.  Its our substitute for art.  Or maybe its our art.  Maybe.

Well, theres the update.  Hopefully more pics tommorow.  Anyone know where I can host ~5meg divX files, I took some of them and would like to show them off.

I posted this in the mass scouting request earlier and you should easily have been able to find this out on your own. I am the webmaster of Team 891, whose web page and my email address are in my sig and profile. Feel free to email me any questions you have and/or look over our web page.

Seriously, myself and the other at least five active CD'ers on my team aren't hard to find ;)
VERY COOL!
are those some crazy omni wheels i see??
Yes, I was going by what was said in the manual as well.  And the 16 figure is on Clippard's website as well, so I can only assume it's closer to being correct.  So I went with the 16 figure and didn't bother with a calculator.  I just estimated it out.  Yes, figuring that 32in^3 at 120 PSI is effectively 64in^3 at 60 PSI minus the 32 that must be left in the tanks.  so 1 cycle of extend retract.  or 2 shots by your counting method.  I whipped out a calculator later and 45psi seemed about right for 4 shots.
If you are using skid-steer as in 2 wheels and 2 skids, your problem may be that you dont have enough weight on the drive wheels.  If you can shift some weight over to them, you will get better traction.

Looks like a swerve drive to me...the globes are probably only for turning

one question....why not have seperate gear boxes and run Bevel gears to the wheels? this way you can have shifting swerve steer.... i was thinking about that a while ago but we decided not to use swerve this year.

I must say tho.....this is one of the slickest swerve gearboxes i've seen...ditto on the slick part


It is both, yet neither. :P




Stop stealing my lines.
The reputation system is really not all that different than the spotlight. It's nice to be recognized for what you say but it shouldn't govern how you think around here. You got something on your mind? Say it. Whether or not it earns you positive or negative rep points, it's your mind. Don't compromise it for the sake of approval.

As it looks like FIRST could be lacking a large amount of spares at the regionals, I think it would be great if teams shipped their entire collection of motors along with their robots.  If you're not using a motor, bring it along with you.  There's enough teams at every regional, that, statistically, they should be able to provide spares for any motor in the kit if everyone did this.

Everyone at FIRST competitions is willing to help out other teams, I think it might just require a little foresight this year to do it effectively.

To me rep points are like cliques at school in the fact that, like others said, you don't need somebody elses opinion to know that you believe in what you said.

If you can't post your mind because you're scared of negative reps, then you really need to start taking this less seriously. You can't make everybody happy. (However, you can get close.  ;))


If you are using skid-steer as in 2 wheels and 2 skids, your problem may be that you dont have enough weight on the drive wheels.  If you can shift some weight over to them, you will get better traction.



I assure you most of our weight is over the drive wheels.
yea, it isnt shiny as in shiny, but shiny as in woah, sweet!

nah, it isnt planetary... in fact it only has 1 sprocket
This sounds like a question for the FIRST Q&A.  I think disassembling the systems and putting one together and changing out cause the other isn't working....  well I think that's the lawyerism that FIRST is discouraging this year, as the other system is clearly interchangeable and such and should therefore be weighed with the robot.  Having it disassembled is just trying to get around the rule.

That being said, why can't you change them out during practice rounds and decide which one you want there?  It's perfectly legal if you pick one before inspection and stick with that one through the competition.

Why not try zip ties? They're cheap, slick, durable, and quick to install!



It may sound bad but it truly works...or at least it did for my team.but of course if you can find an Omni or more torque in your drive you would want to go with that and only use zip ties in a last minute, between matches solution

Kevin here have the right answer.  Your robot do not need to pass inspection to go to practice round on Thursday.  So take advantage of that opportunity to try out both device, and choose the appropiate one for your robot.  After doing so, understand that you cannot change your mind and decide to use the other device on the robot.

You may only use whatever components you included in the weight in during competition, and their replacement parts.
ok, where do i put the coin in and where does the coffee come out???
Come on Joe, there were more then that.
that answers that question, but what level of fabrication can we do at the competition, can we basically change our whole design if we find that neither work as we expected?
nice rollers!

how well is that key slot going to hold up? It looks like you guys sandwiched the rollers in between 2 plates... sweet!


I assure you most of our weight is over the drive wheels.


If you can go to a 14 inch Wheel, skyway has a tube and tire kit that fits on the 12 wheel hub, it is wider and has pretty aggressive tread.  This will also make your bot faster, 12.5inch to 14 inch.  They also were selling the whole thing filled and assembled. The part number for the whole tire and wheel is WHL1250 Sub 300-8 The part number for the tire only, you still have to get a inner tube, is Tire 2062 I don't have notes on the  inner tube.  Good luck BTW some of the pics in posted of this years bots have the 14 inch tires.
What tire pressure are you using?  Gearing?  Be more specific and we'll see what we can advise.


that answers that question, but what level of fabrication can we do at the competition, can we basically change our whole design if we find that neither work as we expected?




I believe the answer to that question is you may change the design of your robot before weight in.  After weight in, you have to stick with your decision.  The level of fabrication you can do at the competition is stated in the rule book.  You may use the machine shop on site, and make parts with whatever raw material you bring to the competition.
where did you get the rollers?
Why not simply try it?

BTW, if you mean 3/4 of the tubing in the kit is on the 120 PSI side of your regulator, then you are clearly using the tubing as a storage device, and this is not allowed.

The rules state that only the tanks may be used as storage devices, and one of the Q & A answers stated that excess tubing was not allowed for compressed air storage.

Yes, we would like larger tanks as well...

Tire pressure.  We tried deflating the tires.  Gearing?  Don't remember of the top of my head. We have the Chips and Drill combined on each side of the bot.  I want to say somehing around 30:1 from the drills and the chips are matched at free speed to the drills.


If we use the default code to run our robot, how do we incorporate navigate to run the ir sensors in autonomous mode?

If you can make it simple, I would appreciate it. I'm just a fabricator who got elected to program the bot.



It was talked about here [thread]216607[/thread].
In addition to those instructions you'll also need the navigate.c and navigate.h files, and you'll need to add a call to navigate() to the User_Autonomous_Code() routine in the user_routines_fast.c file.

Hmm i have heard that alot recently.  We have a grinder that hates one of the other students.  It has an insatiable(sp?) hunger for bits of keyway.


My favorite quote was posted somewhere around here and it wnet somehing liek this:  "everyone knows the best way to lighten a robot is to turn is over, shake vigorously, and throw awa ywhatever falls out".  Last year we had a nutdriver that someone clumsily dropped into an upright piece of our frame stuck in our robot the entire season until a few weeks ago when it was finally missed and so we got it out.
You want to know what the weather in March in New Jersey will be like?

The weather on any day in NJ is directly related to the digit of pi which corresponds to the date on which this said weather is required. :]

Actually, like people above said, it could be cold, and there is a small chance of snow (we have actually had snow as late as April, if i remember right). However, knowing March, there will be plenty of wind. It will be cold. Heavy jackets are recommended, along with gloves and hats (just in case).

And btw, I second what Mr.Holton said - NJ is truly amazing - We have a town named Brick right next to a town named Wall. And we have Double Trouble.

The planned schedule for us has ben 10-8 on the weekends and 4-8 every other day. But, as the due date gets closer and closer the nights get later and later. This friday and Saturday ought to be all nighters. We have to be readyu for the practice comp that the SCRRF is holding...


*Wonders if we will ever make it*
We can do it, I know we can!


Come on Joe, there were more then that.





Ok there was more Mike here it is.

"Steve is this your music?"   " Yes.  Why?"  "Because it sucks."

"Did I zap you, dude?"  "Yes!"  "I'm sorry dude. I thought I just crossed the leads."

Why is everything falling off?

"Whats the experation date on these?"  "Who cares?"

You better close that door before you close the door.

Todays winner is Tom!  Good job!
hahahah thats so great. It's really funny because it's true.

> The simple tasks:
> 1."fetch" (please be specific as to whether you meant drill bit or mill bit)
> 2."hold this for me"
> 3."get out of the way" (please be kind to our freshmen when using this one)


That is so true...
We meet and build about 10 hours a week.  We do have a few more sessions in the late season, but we're always a wee bit behind.  We might spend a bit more time if you count cleanup time in the shop, but that's about it.
The latest our team has ever worked is 7pm because our teachers don't want to stay late, and by then we getting a little bit hungery



the servo is plugged in to the  output 3 but does not move. i read the forums, and i see that they only run off the backup battery. is this true?




Yes. That information is also on page 4 of the RC reference guide from Innovation First.
2-8 peopel after school till about 5:30 on weekdays and about 12:00am to somewhere around 6:00 on weekends.  We will prollyu stayu longer now that time is gettign shorter.  Last year we pulled a few really late nighters. I miss those. lol. (has no life)
What do you think? is it shiny?

My thoughts on reputation points:
I do not think people should be able to give out negative reputation points, since this is not in the spirit of FIRST.  FIRSTers should be giving out positive reputation or not give reputation to a post, not criticizing people for what they write/post in these fourms.
Most people seem to have close to the same story. Last year i was a freshmen but i knew most of the senoirs, i was still stuck with simple tasks(check out "Freshmen Positives" for more on that). generally the whole team was run by 3 tyrannical (shall i say triumverate?) senoirs. This year a whole lot changed (and not just the fact of no longer being a freshmen). The tyranny is gone and all that is left in its path is a working domacracy(spell check please). It's taken us some time to get us back on our feet but we are a more efficient working machine(in my eyes). Anyways, i hope to see you guys at nationals next year as i plan we will qualify once again(does this guy use too many parenthesis or what?) say hello when u see team 701!
First off let me say I am not an active member of Team 60 still, so I don’t know every detail, nor will I pretend that I know everything about this year’s robot or team.  At first glance it seems that there are a lot of angry people in the FIRST community, but then upon a second reflection I realized these people are not angry… just ignorant, ignorance is a person’s worst enemy.  Those of you who are part of the large wave of antipathy in disagreement over the innovative ideas of Teams 60 and 254 need to again realize what FIRST is… a GAME.  I believe you are all loosing site on what this competition is all about.  Many of you incorrectly believe that FIRST is a competition where students MUST be the sole contributors to building the robots.  If you are one of these people I am sorry that you haven’t yet grasped the full meaning of FIRST and let me quote the FIRST web site as I did 2 years ago when this same topic was brought up. “The FIRST Robotics Competition is an exciting, multinational competition that teams professionals and young people to solve an engineering design problem in an intense and competitive way.”

Secondly, it was very clear what Glenn posted as to what the ratio of student machined parts to professionally machined parts was…I believe 9-1.  Or as he stated 90% of all the parts were fabricated by the team.  Now I can tell you from past years experience that a group of students are not capable of doing every task on a piece of machinery such as a robot.  They should not be expected to experiment with welding or other similar tasks.  That would be careless and dangerous.  So I fully believe that 10% of the work was done outside of the team, as it should have been.

Again quoting the FIRST web page, “Involved engineers experience again many of the reasons they chose engineering as a profession, and the companies they work for contribute to the community while they prepare and create their future workforce.”  Now, that is what FIRST has written as to what the competition is.  That being said I would like to know what engineers  or any business professional work alone in their respective fields?  Why then are people criticizing these two remarkable teams on cooperating? Doesn’t that qualify as preparing the future work force?

Lastly these two teams did NOT have to post anything about their robots or release pictures to anyone.  I bet many of you posting negative comments have not let any information out about what your robots are like or what they do.  Teams 60 and 254 have become known in the past few years for graciously posting pictures and information about their robots, and many around FIRST look forward to seeing the production pics of these robots.  The simple gesture of posting these pictures on the internet shows that these two teams are ALL about cooperation and inspiring the FIRST community.  I encourage all of you to not degrade these teams for their willingness to share their ideas.  I know that this will not impact many of you who believe this will “reck” FIRST.  I’m not sure how some of you call yourselves true FIRST participants if you honestly believe that teamwork and cooperation will ruin FIRST.  This all goes back to my first point, that ignorance is one’s worst enemy.  People oppose change because they are ignorant to the future.  I challenge all of you to learn more about these two landmark FIRST teams before you rudely call for their demise.

My hats off to 60 and 254 for again adding new innovation to the FIRST community.  And on a side note despite all this criticism I would like to say thank you to perhaps two of the most under appreciated men in FIRST, Glenn and George for everything they taught me over my duration in FIRST.  These two gentlemen taught me things that I will be able to use for the rest of my life, and for that I will be forever grateful.  So thank you for inspiring me to continually come up with new and innovative ideas.

having them look for nonexistant parts is also fun ie: a metric cresent wrench
but seriously we need them if we want this organization to continue
What was Star Trek? Who were Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Lieuteneant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols)?
I'm only at 4.xxx% poser! Surprised me that it was so low. :]
Where did that come from?
NO WAY!! Im so glad I finally get to see the robot.  Now I can have time to plan all our strategies to beat them. YES! ty 302, you guys are the best!  Can you get more pictures though? im kinda confused on that how that wrench thingy works. hmmmm ill have to sleep on it. :yikes:.  Hey, maybe our robot will be able to drive over it again this year?? that would be exciting eh?




haha looks good guys keep up the high quality expected from LO
I spouted something sort of arrogant in a post a while back along the lines of, "If you do the algebra, you'll see that the total cost of the robot after billing out fabrication at a reasonable hourly rate will add up to several thousand dollars."

I guess I never really did any.

I suppose nobody else did either, or they would have called me on it.

Let's assume 30 unique parts for a major component, of varying complexity, averaging 2 hours each. Since they're making them in batches (at least groups of 4)... these hours could be minimized further. I assume that the average high school student entering a metalworkers union wouldn't be earning much past $20 an hour.

The algebra says that's only $1,200 folks. I wouldn't have gripes if they billed out high school kids at $15 an hour either.

Do we seriously not want these guys to compete with us this year?

If they can keep the total cost of the rest of their robot under $2300... it's fine by me. It's probably in their best interest to document their hours in some way so that it's clear.

But if they estimate their hours... are you seriously going to breathe down their necks?

Compassion has been lacking on my part, and I'll openly apologize if I've offended anyone. I was reminded of a quote.

*"If you judge people, you have no time to love them. And if you love people, you have no desire to judge them. Besides, there may come a time when we, too, will find ourselves more in need of love than judgment."* - Mother Teresa

umm yea, lol just so everyone knows, im just messin with the 302 kids, their my friends.  Figured i should post this just so i dont look like an idiot lol, because its obviously not their robot.  302 always makes high quality robots and i am looking forward to see this years in action.  Funny stuff though.
a hub reduction?? interesting.

Give the keys to your car to your best friend, and have them to take the old lady to the hospital right away, then head off to their appointment with your car.  Stay at the bus stop with the girl of your dreams.  She will be so impressed with your sensitivity to the plight of your friend and your community spirit by helping the old lady, she will immediately want to know more about you.  Get to know her while waiting for the bus, strike up a great conversation, go out on a date.  Let it lead to many others, and eventually to your proposal.  After a short engagement, you get married and have a fantastic honeymoon in Jamaica, and look forward to a wonderful life together.

Meanwhile, you find out the old lady at the side of the road was your spouse's mother.  She is tremendously wealthly.  She is so greatful to your best friend for driving her to the hospital that she immediately amends her will to leave her entire estate to your friend.  She never fully recovers from her injuries, and passes shortly thereafter.  Your best friend inherits the full estate, and immediately moves to the South Pacific with his new-found wealth.  Your wife is furious because she was completely left out of the will, and she blames you (after all, it was YOUR best friend that got all of HER money).  In retribution, she files for divorce, and claims half of your belongings.  Her lawyer is better than yours, and she cleans you out.  She then heads for the South Pacific, and spends the rest of her life with your former best friend and most of your money.  You now live in a small cardboard box on the side of the road.

Moral of the story: when driving, always concentrate on what is on the road ahead of you.  Things on the curbside are just distractions, and should be ignored - no good can come from any of them, no matter how friendly, attractive or needy they may appear.

I've had a few complaints (probably 5 or 6) about how I give out negatives reputations. I've also had one person who's thanked me for a negative reputation that I've given them. I've only had one comment about a positive reputation. I beleive that I give out about 2/3rds approve and 1/3 disapprove. I also leave comments on 90% of my comments, and 99.9% of my negatives

The way that I give out positive reputations is fairly nebulous, but the largest factor is how much reputatation you already have. I hold people with high reputations to a much higher standard if they want to get a positive reputation from me. The way I give out negative reputation is more defined.


- If something you post is wrong, and you provide no supporting information, you get a negative.
- If I have to think really hard to understand what you are saying, you get a negative (this mostly involves spelling and grammar).
- If you post with a negative attitude, you probably get a negative.
- If you post something in the blatantly wrong forum, or multi post a thread, you get a negative
- If post says nothing of value (and it's a technical type forum) you get a negative
- If you comment about a reputation you received publicly, you may get a negative (This thread is an exception, because it is designed to talk about reputation). Take it to PM or IM, and if something is really bad, let Brandon know, in private
- If you post a controversial topic, without it being the time or place to discuss it (or you being the correct person to post about it), then you probably get a negative.


Hopefully that clears up every negative I've given (and now I can point angry people to it, rather then explaining it to them when they are angry ;))

The most important thing to remember is that reputation levels out. There are many more people here who respect your opinion if it is well reasoned, then give out negative reputations if they disagree. If you all you see is a few random negative reputations, then don't worry about it. If you see a consistent trend, hopefully they left comments and you can think about what was said.
What about the freshman who know more than the seniors and are harder workers. Or the 8th grader who learns six machines in 3 weeks...yeh, we got 'em. Brains and hard work aren't necessarily about age or grade.

Hows that DeWalt chopsaw working for you?




Haven't had any problems but then again we've only had it for a couple months.



Also, any plans to shield that controller?  It looks rather exposed, and they will break when they take a good hit.




Yeah that is not the final electronics board and that whole area will be encased.

Hey, everyone.  I've heard a lot of people talking about how they left out the groove bit when putting together their double solenoids to slow the leaking, which is what our team did, but has anyone actually gotten it to stop leaking all together?  Also, is it legal to use old double solenoids?  Thanks very much!




Yes there is a rule that says you can use previous year's solenoids.


At first glance it seems that there are a lot of angry people in the FIRST community, but then upon a second reflection I realized these people are not angry… just ignorant, ignorance is a person’s worst enemy.  Those of you who are part of the large wave of antipathy in disagreement over the innovative ideas of Teams 60 and 254 need to again realize what FIRST is… a GAME


From what I've seen there are, in fact, some angry people. Just because a person is angry, does not make them ignorant and it is unfair to say such. No one has the right to tell people how they should or should not feel about something. You can disagree with them all you want, but no one has any right to tell someone not to be upset or angry about something.



Now I can tell you from past years experience that a group of students are not capable of doing every task on a piece of machinery such as a robot.  They should not be expected to experiment with welding or other similar tasks.  That would be careless and dangerous.  So I fully believe that 10% of the work was done outside of the team, as it should have been.


I know quite a few groups of students that are fully capable of "doing every task" on a robot and then some. It is not a requirement that a robot be welded, or that a student should be asked to weld anything. This whole thread is about experimenting with something new and different, correct?



I’m not sure how some of you call yourselves true FIRST participants if you honestly believe that teamwork and cooperation will ruin FIRST.  This all goes back to my first point, that ignorance is one’s worst enemy.  People oppose change because they are ignorant to the future.  I challenge all of you to learn more about these two landmark FIRST teams before you rudely call for their demise.


I don't think anyone has said that teamwork and cooperation will ruin FIRST. I think what people have been saying is, with this advanced level of cooperation, what stops the 1,000 teams in FIRST from building 1,000 identical robots? Why not just ship a set of instructions with the kit of parts each year? I have not seen anyone call for the demise of either of these teams. Some people are simply not happy with what they are doing.

If someone is unhappy, they're unhappy. What's done is done, and the situation isn't going to change. *shrug* What can you do?

I agree. When I hear of people making fun of freshmen, I tend to think more about lazy seniors then stupid freshmen.

The 120 psi is a hardware limit - the compressor has a relief valve.  Keeping it running will not charge it above 120psi unless you modify the compressor.




And the existing software code provides a redundant safety feature that provides two-fault tolerance. In the event that the relief valve should fail (not an unheard-of occurrence), the software limits the pressure output of the compressor to a safe level well below the burst pressure ratings of any of the pneumatic components provided in the FIRST kit. For that reason, the existing software that turns the compressor "Off" at 120psi must always take priority over all other functions.

(and yes, it also works the other way around - the relief valve acts as a backup for the software, in case you accidentally do something to mess with the software-commanded shut off)

just because Kingman is sponsored by FORD, i had to post this...


Imagine, if FORD and CHEVY collaborated to produce a car...now ford and chevy would have a great product, and succeed...

but then you would have tons and tons of FORD and CHEVY fans knocking at the CEO's door in the morning to dispute the decision to join the dark and light side(sorry, im a diehard FORD fan), and we would'nt have a fun little rivalry ;)...


just a humorous little analogy i thought that pertains to the subject at hand
Well as a freshman (I'm now a senior) the team leader/driver who was a senior at the time was in the same room as me in the hotels for both regionals and nats. Him and his senior friend developed what they liked to call "Freshman Privilege" in which they would do anything to torment us freshmen. I remember one such occurence was when i got locked out of my room and then only to have the door opened and have all this water dumped on me :(  not the greatest of times..soo.. i treat most of the freshman ok because of my traumatic experiences but by no means do they get away with anything, and yes they still have to do the menial jobs but dont all freshman?

this is so true andy keeps denying that devin has beaten him multiple times
for some reason after connection the motors to pwm 3 and 4 the robot just goes crazy it just sought of goes everywhere bashing everything. Anyone knows why?
this year I am the only member on our team with experience. It's hard to have to go through the whole brainstorming, design, and building process when you're the only one who has experience. It's a slow and painful process having to teach people how to use a mill or a lathe. especially having to show them again and again because they keep forgetting. There's also the other problem. A lot of them don't realise how much effort has to be put into this in order to succeed. I'm trying to get at least 50% attendance from everybody, but so far i'm the only one who has been there more than 50% of the time. so nobody knows what's happened to the robot designwise and what changes have been made. The Freshmen on our team were usually ignored on the earlier years until this year (since they're all freshmen except for me) so they were a little more involved and take a look at what they accomplished. http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=6259&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose

That's truly an awesome paintjob from our freshmen.


moral of the story: don't judge a book by it's cover?


I remember one such occurence was when i got locked out of my room and then only to have the door opened and have all this water dumped on me :(


Awww ... that's horrible.

I know this thread was started in good fun and I'm glad to see it's stayed that way. I just wanted to throw this out there for the people who might take this thread a little more seiously than it was intended ...

When I was a freshman on 93, I wasn't treated lower than anyone else. True, I knew next to nothing when it came to electronics and mechanics, but that didn't mean I spent the year fetching aluminum magnets and metric crescent wrenches -- I spent the time learning from the people with more experience than me. I hope all the "lazy seniors" can teach the "stupid freshmen" a thing or two before their time on the team is up, rather than making the freshmen play 'fetch'.


> Keep in mind without Freshmen we couldn't have anyone else, whos gonna take over the robotics team!?
Yep. :)
Many on this forum have expressed concern for what has taken place this robotics season. A reason for this might be that is a previously unexplored avenue. Not that it is previously un thought of, just really never been explored to this extent before. Team 60 and team 254 are to outstanding teams in the FIRST community. As a rookie team 60 was my first encounter with a superb robot. ( 2001 ) They were one of the best built robots I had seen my life ( I saw this because they knocked us out in the quarterfinals of our division at nationals ). Team 60 has been one of the few robots I’ve looked forward to seeing every year. Our team has personally become stronger because of team 60. 1) because of their brilliance in performance making us desire to compete at their level, and 2) because of their outreach efforts to aid teams with things like their Marketing and promotional package and guidelines. 254 I have become more knowledgeable of during the past year or so. Hearing and watching them succeed and propel themselves into the national spotlight of FIRST has been an exciting process. They are among one of the teams I respect most for their effort to bring awareness of FIRST, science and technology.

I believe, like many others, that we all have great respect for what 60 and 254 have done for the FIRST community. We all greatly appreciate your efforts in this strive. I personally want to thank you for this.

I believe your thoughts and intentions in your special team development, bonding, and real life experience where pure and good. Call me blindly optimistic but I also believe that no one in this discussion believes that you did not work hard, or did not put forth good effort to create a superb robot.

No one is questioning your ethics, your desire to learn, your desire to teach, your desire to help, your desire to work, or your desire to share. We all understand that you would not have been elevated to the status that both your teams are at by not working hard.

It is the opinion of many however that the path taken to the extent it was taken is a bit shocking and a bit upsetting to some. There are certain rules and provisions made by FIRST and what you have done is touched on a grey area, and what seems to me has been somewhat of an unspoken boundary, a road that has not been traveled. It is easy to see how this may effect FIRST in the long run, does this kind of partnership continue to happen, or does it not.. If it were to continue, where might it end? Again blind optimism has it that it is my belief these questions do not arise because people want you out of competition, but more in questions of fairness within guidelines of the rules.

Even in FIRST’s statement there can be great things accomplished where it is still illegal. In years of old it may have been illegal to proclaim the catholic church wrong, punishable by death, but it didn’t stop those old famous guys to say “ Hey maybe Earth goes around the sun “ or “ Maybe the earth isn’t flat but rounded. “ So what I’m saying is it might end up being an ok thing, however we still must be careful.

To those who have stated “ If this were 2 rookie teams would anyone have looked twice upon it, “ I say maybe, most likely they would have been talked to by older veteran teams but it would not have received the hipe. However with as much respect as your teams command comes great responsibility and scrutiny. You will always be in the spotlight as long as you are on top. You may not have asked to be put there, but when you do things as amazing as your teams, you automatically get put their like it or not. Its just the nature of things, with great Status comes great responsibility. When you make any stance on a grey area you’ll find those who support your stance and those who do not. Especially if some of the members feel “ shafted, “ or “ cheated. “

I still feel some questions are unanswered, but I do not feel it necessary to post them again. I also believe most all questions will be answered if and when FIRST releases a statement.

I want to close by thanking Team 60 and Team 254 for all they have done for the FIRST community, and the noticeable amount of work that they put forth this year in trying to elevate their level of competition. Tho I still might disagree with the way they went about this style of collaboration, I still do not believe that they had the wrong intentions. It is still my hope that FIRST does not all together venture down this path, but I will stand behind FIRST’s decision and adjust accordingly, even if I might disagree.

Thank you again 60 and 254 for all you’ve done and continue to do.

Dan
oh no why would they make that rule. last year we were aloud to do it.


sometimes i get the feeling that the guys at FIRST like to just make up rules.
i.e. the sound rule
Well right now I've been working a lot, 12 hours a day on weekends and around 7 to 8 on weekdays due to the fact that I live here at school (its a residential boarding school).  I've actually considered the thought of moving into the lab as I spend more time there than I do in my dorm or anywhere else on campus..........I was even in the lab during the Valentines dance on Saturday night......needless to say some people werent to happy with me after that.
Ok you have my attention...

afrobot? :p

Keep in mind without Freshmen we couldn't have anyone else, whos gonna take over the robotics team!?



Yes I know this whole thread was started as fun but heres a little food for thought...
I know that freshman on my team are treated now as equals, all people on 250 are treated as equals and that is how we do things.  I dont know how other teams do things but age and grade is no different then gender and race which has no effect to our team.  Many of you should take a lil more time to think of what you post on here because these forums are read by many FIRST staff and what you say reflects upon your whole team.

P.S.~ werent we all freshman at a time and arent freshman the people who are taking over our teams as we graduate?


If another robot runs  into it, will the arm slide off the bar?



i hope no...cause we made the arm to be resistan enough to stay in the bar in the case of a bot come and hit it.  :D
2 drills = drive
um.... 1, 2, 3, 4 cylinders,
i want a keyang motor(1lbs) on for another application which should weigh a total of maybe 3lbs at the most if we have 3lbs to spare....
and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of bungee. or maybe a heavy duty spring.
They probably archived them to save space, they are still there, they just moved them to make room. Monday night they had no more space left, you'll notice all forms posted before Monday are the ones gone.
are your motor polarities correct? if one were backwards, the robot would turn when it thinks it's going forward, and go forward or back when it thinks it's turning... this would cause some really strange behavior.
You can just leave lots of slack.  If you have a cyclinder on an arm put an air tank up there and connect with loose tubing.

goto statements are BAD. Use a do-while or something. :P
its to use instead of the paddles that the human players were going to be provided  :eek:


where did you get the rollers?




i bet they cut some delrin (sp?) down to size.. delrin, mmm, i love that stuff- so easy to lathe and so efficient
I never saw any such control thing in the code - where is it?  And doesn't this require that the compressor and switch be wired up in a very specific way?  I fail to see how this works...


Have you asked on the Q&A if you can change margins/font?





No.

I took it to mean I couldn't change their font or their form, but I could use any font in my answers as long as it's not less than 10.
You should be running the compressor forward - it probably was not working right, or something like that.
For 'teasing' hair.. not bot related.
I believe the 883s are good for any drill motors that aren't last year's or this year's, so you should be fine...
Can we please get some serious imput (though I do like my fun and games (see above posting))?

> Well it turns like you wouldn't believe and it seems to work great!

Good!
I'm glad someone has had good sucess with casters.
Make sure you note your designs for future years. It will come in handy.
Hey hey... a lot like our design. We have our motors on the same axis as the wheels, and our wheels are hollow so the gear reduction (cim: 1:11, drill: 1:41) actually fits within the wheel. Plus it is swivel drive. But it looks very cool and seems to be a very good way to get up the stairs. Too bad we use 6" wheels, we cant do a thing about the stairs.
Sorry for the double post, but I have some updates
Well, first off we weighed in at 91 lbs w/o our battery. The goal hooks (not pictured) were installed at the time of weighing as well as 90% of our plow, and everything for the arm pictured thus far.
So, predicted weight 105 w/ battery, leaving us roughly 25 lbs for our arm.
Not too shabby.
Also, I'm hoping to upload some links to video clips within the next day or two of us in action. I hope to edit this post to do so, so keep checking back every now and then.
Later!
You're going to "comb" the field clean?
It looks like you didn't use your multi-drive system? any particular reason?
Well I put other in the vote box.
Basically this year we're using a table-driven dead reckoning auto mode.
We have an autonomous function selection panel, a switch panel of 10 switcehs, each to perform a single funtion. For example, one switch might be "grab goal" or "uncap goal" or "drive back to driver station" and so forth.
At the init of auto mode, a table is set up bild from all the smaller functions tables, and the autonomous mode is executed step by step.
That means you probably won't see us doing the same thing twice.
See you at competition!
nice bot! just wondering what type of stering you guys were using, b/c our team is using tank turning and we ran into a problem with the pneumatic wheels gripping too much. How did u solve that problem? Can u guys hang?

The only reasons i see this is fair is for Driver practice. I seem to find that ok, and fair to other teams.

on a side note (related to question):
Can we build ou r controls after the 6 week build?
I mean, continue to add switches and such, or is that not a good idea?
I could go both ways on this one.

Increasing the pressure in the tires reduces the contact patch, so you can reduce traction that way. That should help turning somewhat, without a whole redesign. Hmm, Hummer-style tire inflation, anyone? :-)

We at Innovation First have confirmed the problem you have noticed.  The root cause is that the silkscreen labels (REV/FWD/GND) on the Robot Controller are incorrect, and the aliases in the Default Code were set to match them.  The simplest fix is to swap the reverse/forward aliases in ifi_aliases.h, as some of you have already done, and to ignore the REV/FWD/GND labels.

Another option is to swap the connections on the M- and M+ outputs of the Spike Relay Module to achieve the correct polarity.

New Default Code with these aliases fixed will be on our web site soon.  A note will also be placed in the 2004 Robot Controller Reference Guide regarding the incorrect labels.

The larger disks are polycarbonate
The smaller disks are actually lexan and each of those have a center hole with a small metal dowel rod throught the middle.  As with most onmi wheels there are two halves that have places for the axels milled out of the middle and then the two halves are fastened together, sandwiching the small disk's axle.

Yes, you can work on the OI after the robot ships. If you haven't had time to pretty it up or you don't like the layout you can keep working on it.

Ok thanks for the info.  Just a note of info for you, polycarbonate is the plastics "physical" name, Lexan is a copyrighted trade name for the first developed polycarbonate by General Electric in the late 1960's.

This is sort of what I was getting at.  As a teacher/coach/mentor, working an additional 30 hours a week during "build season" is something that I plan for and my wife is able to cope with.  The problem comes in when "ship-date" is not the end of the intensive building season - it is just the beginning of the intensive driving/autonomous programming season.

How do other mentors/coaches feel about this?

-Mr. Van
so how do u guys get on the bar, im assuming the arm or a winch? also some inside about your drive-train.
Thanks

Man, I got you all nailed on this one....remember, just because everyone says the same thing, doesn't always mean its right  ;)
sorry to let you down, but its realy hard to write "canned" line sensor code. things like the mounting of the sensors; how close/far they are apart, how high they are off the ground, even how many of them there are; all go into the code. you could have a very simple 2 sensor tracker with 2 if statements, or you could have 8 sensors and historisas with the acceleromitor from last year helping to. there is the some old PBASIC code [here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18031&highlight=line+tracker) if you have **no** idea where to start. best of luck, Jacob
wow thats realy amazing. how are they woking for you guys?
How many sensors do you have and what is their configuratation? (I.E. We have three sensors. The middle one and one of the side ones read the line when the robot is going off the moving away from the line.) If you can give some details like that, somebody will probably whip a quick example up. (Maybe me... :))

wife?!

you still have a wife?!

this must be your 1st year :^)

lots of mentors catch grief from all directions for the amount of time we spend on this program - FIRST should start a parallel program for all the "FIRST Widows" out there. Find something for them to do when we all dissapear into the black hole for 6 to 10 weeks each winter.
i was talking to stu bloom about these yesterday...they look good guys!  very good job.
Our electronics looks similar ( we didnt do as neat of a job with the holes ) but its in 3 layers. RC, powerblock, and main breaker on top, then 5 victors, our **ground stud**** and the big brass 40 amp fuse block on the second layer, and the third layer has 4 spikes, the main fuse block, and the 7.2 volt battery. the whole thing is like 12x10x11", which is less then a sqare foot. however the battery and compresser got delegated to the chasies team, so there not my problem :D .

**ground stud. when i say ground stud, i meen a piece of angle aluminum that i drilled a bunch of holes in. is the "ground stud" an essental piece? it would be a pain to redo it now, and i see no added electrical benifit. actualy the system i have now can deffenetly carry the current.

There are two reasons why the manufacturer of the compressor would like the polarity observed for the compressor motor.

A) The fan in the motor was designed to move the most air with the least noise/power when turned in one direction only(axial fans).  That direction will be when you observe the correct polarity.  (result- motor will run cooler and longer)

B) Almost all series wound DC/AC universal motors or PM DC motors have the commutator shifted with respect to the main magnetic field to minimize commutation arcing.  So they are most efficient when turning in the direction of the default polarity( e.g. the recommended polarity).  This is the reason why the motor will not produce the same rpm/power in either direction.  (Also, a radial fan operates equally well in either direction, an axial fan (like the compressor has, does not.)  When such a motor is reversed, the commutation can be seen to arc more than the forward case, this arcing will cause the brushes and commutator life to be reduced, the commutator temperature to rise.  Further, the arcing represents energy lost and hurts the overall efficiency of the motor.  (Efficiency is what you get/what you pay for...)

Motors can be designed to work the same in either direction, but at an overall loss in efficiency.

So, bottom line:  wire the compressor backwards will work, but will run hotter, use more power and produce less work, and will have a shorter life than normal.




So in other words, we should correct the problem even if it appears to be running correctly as of this moment.


I was looking for some info for CSS/XHTML design, and found this pretty good article.  It's pretty basic, but it does a good job of explaining how to effectively design a webpage using CSS.  Thought I'd pass it along:

thank you so much.

As a webmaster in training stuff such as this helps a huge amount.
A pretty good primer, but it doesn't really go in depth to a few of the subjects or the theory behind them. A lot of really good supplementary stuff to this article is scattered about, especially on weblogs, but very Googlable. I found a really good implementation of just about everything mentioned in this article [here](http://www.team188.com/)!

I spent a good 10 minutes looking for this yesterday, but I ask, why not take the dimensions yourself? I would, but our robot it finished and shipped already.
Just as a heads up: if those plates are made out of aluminum, you may run into distortion in the keyway after repeated use. We had a similar problem on the hub of a large sprocket we were using on our arm this year, and we replaced it with steel after noticing it was enlarging. You may want to explore this a bit more when you start driving.

Overall, a FINE looking design! :)

Matt
one possibility, make it clear that the team NEEDS those things, and if they are not returned your robot is not going to be fully functional

and if you dont have safety glasses your team will not be allowed in the pit area, which will be somewhat of a problem, since thats where your robot will be?


I would hate to punish the whole group by ending the team...




I agree that cancelling the team is not the best option.  However, a whole team punishment may be what is needed.  There is a student on your team who knows who is doing it, and will not want to be punished for it.  That is when the student will come forward and you'll find your theif (hopefully).  As for the students who aren't doing it, they'll move on and realize that it isn't their fault and they (directly) aren't being punished.  This has been used on our team fairly well.  Two years ago when some students broke curfew, the entire team was punished with an earlier curfew and room checks.  There were no more curfew problems (at least to my knowledge).  Team talks (lectures or tellings) coming from the people in charge can be good also.  Let them know that you know it is happening and propose a solution.  You can normally tell by people's reaction who is doing it or at least who knows who is doing it.  I wish you the best of luck.
We've had a problem at De Anza, also.  Our $3000 Vaio laptop disappeared two weeks ago (during a robotics session), and on it our full inventor plans for the robot.  Fortunately we had enough progress on the robot that we didn't really need the plans anymore, but there went our hopes for an Inventor Award submission.

We did a full investigation through the school administration.  Some kids have stopped coming to robotics since then...perhaps they were responsible?  Who knows.

We've talked about putting web cams around the room, but so far we have not taken any specific actions.

It really bites that we have to even have this conversation.

Good luck,

Eric.
I know our team has a locked supply closet that only the adults have the keys to, and only certain kids are allowed into (with the adult's keys) In our computer room, only so many people are allowed/there is always an adult.  We just got laptops w/ docking stations donated, and we are being SUPER protective about them.  You just have to watch kids and lock the expensive things up.  We also have sign in/out sheets, so maybe if something did happen, we could narrow it down to who was there.  When we sign out, we also must have an adult intial, so its obvious we can't walk out with a $200 box of safety glasses.  I'm really sorry about your team stealing, you often think better of kids and things like this highly disappoint you.  At one time we had a problem with kids kicking in the door to our facility, and that was quickly solved (only the adults have keys, when you show up and there's only 2 kids in the building, its kinda obvious)You could also start taking away privliges until someone fesses up or someone tells, its kinda of tattle tale-ish and hard on kids who didn't do anything, but sometimes it works....constant supervision is probably key
hope this helps a little bit
Ooo man we have the same problem.  The only really major thing thing that was stolen was ram.  The rest is stuff we just don't put back into the right spot.
components from our team's computers-Always have someone in the computer room watching the little kids.  The best thing I could say is make sure everything is super organized.  This will make it easy to find out if is soemthign is missing.  Thus when something goes missing you'll be able to find out quickly and make sure that the kids either find it.


VERY COOL!
are those some crazy omni wheels i see??



Yes we have omni wheels, and some very beastly snow hog tires;)
Hold a Mandantory All-hands meeting, and address the problem to the entire team. Get the problem out in to the open, make sure everybody know what will happen if they are caught removing items from your work area. If need be list out the punishments. i.e. Not going to regionals/Nats/Kicked off team for good.

During the all hands meeting ask that if the materials are returned with in a few days by the people who took them, there will be no consequences. As long as they know there not getting in trouble they should have the common sence to bring it back.

If none of this works, make sure an adult or senior student is in the room at all times to make sure nothing gets taken, this however is not a good use of time, but if it needs to be done, it needs to be done.

-Aaron
yeah, we're goingtoo. Hopefully, some of our kinks will have disappeared so we can have a pretty good run over there...Chesapeake and NASA were real nice about sponsoring this event so we can test out our robot on a real field, as was the National Building Museum. Props for all three partys!

I can't wait to see the other designs that will be present in D.C. ;)
Well, I think it's awesome and the best thing ever.  But I'm biased. ;)
Our team has a locked supply closet with only about 5 or 6 keys... only given to adults, and only certain kids are allowed in there under supervision.  We also have a computer room, and before there really hasn't been much to steal, but we just got almost new laptops with docking stations (:D ) and we are watching those like they're gold.  We also have sign in/out sheet so we know who was at which meeting, times etc.  and adults have to intial you out, so its kinda hard to steal stuff since they see you, it's also really noticeable if you open the door at the facility.  We have had stealing issues in the past, and that's when we got the locked closet, plus i don't think there's a place that the adults can't see, so it would be difficult.  The computer room also has an adult in it most of the time.
Hope this helps
I can't decide on a side to take in this discussion, since I feel this is both a good idea, and a bad idea.

I believe, in a way, allowing this is in the spirit of FIRST. You can think of it as debugging/beta testing after the product is complete. We all know a machine has flaws, and it's also "beta testing" if you will that solves these problems. I've always looked at the first 6 weeks as 1 big prototype/base build project. My team has never built a second robot, but we have continued to program and use simulators. Granted this can't solve a lot of mechanical problems, but it does solve a lot or program errors. As far as building spare parts in the off season goes. I know a lot of teams have done this already before. To my knowledge, you've always been able to create spare parts and bring them to the event, just never bolt on assemblys or radically change your design after it has been shipped. For example, you were not able to create a drive train, assemble it, and $@#$@#$@#$@# it with your robot, then design and build an entirely different drive train. I may be wrong on this, but this was always my understanding.

As far as building a second additionala robot for testing and such. I feel it is unfair to the rookie teams as opposed to the more experienced. Teams just starting out, or even teams that have been around 2-3 years, don't have the funds to buiild a second bot. "Too bad for the rookies," some of you might be thinking, which is just wrong. Remember, we were all rookies once, so put yourself in their shoes. You see teams that build a second robot, and have an amazing driver from being able to practice in the "off-season" (now should be called extended-season). How does that seem fair to you? Just because you don't have the funds, you don't get the same opportunities as someone else?

So do I agree with it or disagree with it, it's an issue that I honestly can not comment on.

And Mr. Van. Congratulatioons on still having a wife after the 6 weeks, must be some woman you have. Let's see how she handles another 6 weeks now :)
Um... you might want to be more specific in your question. You could also try searching earlier posts, because there is a lot of assorted information on this topic.
I agree, I've seen this topic discussed to death, search before you post, look in the white pages too.
It is 1/2" thick, it's the frame / track for our creative tank drive and they each weigh about 4.5 pounds
From the sound of it, it seems like this is theft for pawning. If it's that, then when you guys work on the bot, do a lock in. Don't allow anyone to leave and no one to enter untill they are oked by a mentor or teacher. This includes a search if necessary. Also tell the team flat up what's up, and tell them it's going to be like this untill the stuff is returned, or if the theif turns themself in.
the "problem" is not arising because FIRST is allowing us to keep our controller for another few weeks, all besides the rookies, everyone had an oi and rc to work with to control their clone robot in the event their team decided to go down that path. I personally think that there is nothing wrong with driving a bot around, getting practice. In fact, I see no real problem with them building a second robot to trouble shoot a design with. Unless the contraption was built during the 6 week period, they have to re-engineer the part on site at the regional. Anything that the team is able to construct within that first day I see no problems with.It's not liek they can completely re-design and build their arm out of raw materials when they arrive. This is nothing new for FIRST teams and I see no reason why everyone is getting all upset. Granted, the prgrammers get a few more weeks but then, I believe that such rules even the playing field for rookie teams who have not been able to construct an autonomus mode, and have a higher curve to climb than veterans. In all honesty, the effect of FIRST allowing teams to keep their oi will be minimal at most. Maybe we'll see more teams who run can with a functional autonomous mode this time. ;)
I know that our team has a minimum time commitment, other wise you can't go on trips (new this year, and has made more people come) also, you have to make things fun and get kids moving, working and doing things.  Having kids work and then see the final result (the robot, or the arm or the base something that moves, that natured stuff) really makes them feel special, especially new kids, now on my 3rd year, i know whatever i do in the machine shop will make the robot work, so as you get older you don't mind putting wheels together or simple stuff, versus the rookies putting the arm together, seeing a end result really helps, although the required time makes them come in the first place.



**ground stud. when i say ground stud, i meen a piece of angle aluminum that i drilled a bunch of holes in. is the "ground stud" an essental piece? it would be a pain to redo it now, and i see no added electrical benifit. actualy the system i have now can deffenetly carry the current.



While I can't get the wiring diagram to load to verify my statement, you are only allowed to wire the robot as shown in the wiring diagram.  Given that the ground stud is in the wiring diagram, you do have to use the one that is provided.  I doubt that your custom ground stud would pass inspection.  While it may be a pain to change it, you probably need to be safe.

Matt
Considering the worth of the items being taken, I'd pursue further action:

Write a letter to all parents.  Send it out and ask them to attend a mandatory meeting with their students.  Ask a school security guard to be there, or a school officer.  Remind them that stealing is a crime, add that anyone can anonymously bring back the items at any time without punishment, but if nothing is done about it, more serious measures will be taken.  In the meantime, ask students to check in and check out of meetings with a lead mentor.

This may seem a little harsh, but it seems like this is an ongoing problem.  It stinks that these kinds of things happen... but they do happen, and need to be dealt with accordingly.  Best of luck with this.
Just curious... but did you guys have a leverage problem with the way you pull up that arm? I know last year when we tried to make an extending horizontal bar we had lots of problems with leverage, I was wondering if you guys ran into issues with that and how you went about fixing it. Your bot looks good, good luck!
I received a respond from someone who wishes to remain nameless in this matter, so I will respect his/her wishes and post this message for him/her.


**************************************************
We have had problems with people other than the students stealing stuff. We have noticed shop teachers will also take stuff. For example: Sometimes we forget to clean things up and these things tend to get placed in the shop teachers (locked cabinents). (dont ask how we found this out....)

We are also missing other items which we know we did not leave out. They are also probably in the shop teachers hands. As you can tell our team does not have a good relationship between shop class and robotics. We try to combat theft by locking up all our stuff in cabinents and by keeping things in our main advisors room. We also lock up more expensive stuff such as digital cameras and edu bot stuff. Something you could probably get a file cabinent for cheap to lock stuff up. Or you could even make something out of plywood.

Just thought I would let you know it may not be just the students....
If you have anymore questions just ask!

Hey Matt (and others),

I will be in town this weekend visitng friends at UCLA. I think I am going to drop by at the scrimmage to see the robots. Even if you don't have a robot to bring to this scrimmage, you can still drop by for a chat ;-).



thats awesome makes me wanna come by just to see the Great Ken Leung
Back when I was with 247, there was one student of the class (who shall remain nameless) that didn't care about the team.  The person stole 128MB and a PII Processor from one of the CAD computers while the FIRST teacher was on a field trip with another class and the substitute wasn't watching.  It was well known who the culprit was, and was turned in.  To my knowledge the school said something to the effect of:  'We know you did it, don't tell us you didn't.  If we get the items back, we will not get police involved.'

As for your situation..

Someone said to have a letter mailed home, but I would advise against that.  If I were a theif, and heard that letters would be mailed home, I would intercept the mail just as I did when I was expecting a bad report card *shifty eyes*

I would suggest, hold a parent meeting.  Possibly don't discuss with the students the nature of the meeting,  call it travel discussion or something(which could partly be true, should a punishment be no travel for the theif).  Call directly the parents who do not attend and tell them directly the matter. (A message on an answering service is not good enough).
I'm willing to bet most parents do not want their kids to be theives and are willing to say "I think my child may have taken these, there is a box with it in the basement.  How can I return it?"

Compile a list of what has been stolen, such as the box of safety glasses.  Make sure there is a quality description of what has been taken, as well as how to test. (Such as, if RAM were taken and installed, have parents check how much RAM is in their machine and check against original specs).

Personally, I think if you expect to see the items returned, you must have an amnesty policy.

Should after other steps have been taken, you notice still more things being stolen, address a Sign In/Sign Out policy for attendees of a meeting/build session.  When addressing, tell students "There has been a problem with items being stolen... if you have nothing to hide this will not have a bad effect on you."

Some may say it makes the feel like a criminal when they havn't stolen anything.  Address to the students that "stolen items must be replaced with team funds.  Therefore, it costs you more when someone steals from the team."  I think that will make students prefer innocent searches over having to pay more or fundraise more to replace stolen goods.

But most importantly: Do Not Give Priority To One Student Over Another.  A rookie should be given the same treatment as your veteran main driver, student leader, or anyone else.

Very creative, cheap, simplistic, and professional looking. Good idea with common materials and not having to go buy a label maker and the paper or vinyl for it. Just imagine the designs and possibilities with different fonts and colored paper. Looks like I'm going to retire the Sharpie. :D
If you change your size to 640x480, the other acceptable size, your file size will be smaller.
What if it's something NASA hasn't discovered yet?
Yeah, my team doesn't have one either, it's getting frustrating because our animation is done and I don't feel like uploading 240 megs to a website that keeps getting full on Sunday night.


If we are using a distance sensor manufactured by Sharp, would we be able to use it on the robot?


If the device is P/N GP2GD12, then it's probably okay. I know some testing has been done and that it did not interfere with the Vishay infrared sensors. I would confirm it with the FIRST engineering guys.

Finally you posted these pictures!! Yeah it was pretty sweet seeing it hang there for the first time.
I was wondering if there was anyone who is going to Chesapeake that would like a roommate or someone to help pay half or whatnot for a hotel this year, since my team isnt going to go I still want to go and see the great teams that are going to be there this year, If there is anyone who is interested in this PM me or e-mail me at [email="greenguy365@yahoo.com"]greenguy365@yahoo.com[/email]
Any sort of self respecting shipping company will have a small station for wrapping things in saran wrap.  Boxes shipped on pallets on trucks are usually wrapped in saran wrap type stuff to keep then together.  Whatever shipping company to deliver your robot to should be able to handle wrapping or metal banding your crate.

I suppose this is the difference between Ken and me: people show up just to meet him. ;)

I'm pretty sure we'll be at the scrimmage.  Whether or not I'll have slept the past two days is undetermined but I think we'll be there.

... what does 255 have to do with this post ...? :confused:

Way to go team 115!!! It's great to see that there are FIRST teams like yours out there! :D




FYI

I was team mentor on team 255 who competed from 1999-2002 and were National Champs in 2000. All the Teachers and the principal form those years have moved on to other schools and without faculty sponsors the school sadly and reluctantly decided to abandon FIRST - they still are active in Botball and were National Champs in 2001 and placed highly in subsequent regional competitions.  I currently mentor 254 and 1043 -  I just think that we should share good news as well as controversy.  As a matter of fact I am glad to see that the controversy is about too much cooperation!

Here in No. Cal, several teams have opened up their practice fields to teams with fewer resources, among them 481, 254 and 115.
Ya if someone could post thiers' with mounting information that would be extremely helpful!  I have one I'm working on but am having problems actually keeping it on the line. :p  It does fine in straight aways but curves and corners well... lets just say its a work in progess.  If anyone would like the information/code im working on IM or PM me.
I'm rather new to all of this.  I was drafted just last week to help in the programming.   On looking it all over, it seems to me that the programming should begin when the construction begins.  A fully functioning robot is not needed to test the code in all circumstances (it is the best, of course).

In my panic to bring myself up to speed, seeing as how I've never programmed a robot before, I built a mini-bot using a robot kit that the school had sitting in a corner collecting dust.  I think I spent 2 hours on it.  With this silly mini-bot I have hammered out a potential solution to the "follow the white line" using the kits sensors.  If what I have doesn't quite work, I think I know what to do next.

They finish the robot tonight...and now my work begins.  Wish me luck!

cool thanks
(in response to "Autonomy is forcing every team I know that is **serious** about trying to maximize there chances of doing well in the robot competition to build 2 robots")

I really have to disagree with how its a neccessity- we (341) are serious about doing well in this competition, but there is no way we could build 2 robots. First of all, we would not be able to afford two of every part, considering we are using almost every motor. Buying an additional OI, a bunch of spikes and victors, and all the other parts for our robot is just simply not possible. But hey, we still showed up all day on friday, saturday, sunday, and monday, 50+ hours in total over the weekend.

Keep in mind we are a veteran team with access to a full machine shop (tech center alliance), chances are if we can't make a second robot then the majority of other teams can't as well..


I can tell you we would LOVE to have a second daisy to practice autonomous with. The fact is, we can't do that. Last year we seeded 4th in Galileo and won it all even after only having one robot, thanks to our programmer spending hours on perfecting his gyro. I applaud all of the teams that can achieve this, but we're thrilled to just finish our one robot.
Beautiful.
Our programmer has been working from day one.  We switched out RC's on last years bot and he has programmed several options for competition.  It takes more time to switch the battery on our robot than it would to make a new program.

Work from week one and you won't need the extra time.


Has anyone made a mobile OI? I mean has anyone made a mobile controller for the robot, like so we wouldn't have to be sitting next to an outlet everytime we drive the robot. I was thinking that since the adapter is 9V DC, that I could take a 9V battery and hook it up to the power input of the OI(I just don't know how), and that would power the OI instead of the adapter. I was just wondering if anyone has done this or has been thinking about it. Can it be done my way or if anyone has a better way?




Sure.  Its really simple.  Get yourself a 12V SLA battery from an alarm system, or any other battery you happen to have on-hand, a 9v voltage regulator chip, and either buy or cannabalize a plug.  Wire it all together and you have a mobile oi.
Thanks very much for the info.  Now can anyone tell me if **any** team managed to stop the double solenoid from leaking?


While I can't get the wiring diagram to load to verify my statement, you are only allowed to wire the robot as shown in the wiring diagram.  Given that the ground stud is in the wiring diagram, you do have to use the one that is provided.  I doubt that your custom ground stud would pass inspection.  While it may be a pain to change it, you probably need to be safe.

Matt




Yeah, you definatly can't use just angle bracket for your ground stud.

Besides, aluminum isn't a great conductor, you are introducing extra resistance into your system that *could* cause problems.

I was under the impression that you weren't allowed to do that much tampering (let alone substitution) in your control setup.


If you change your size to 640x480, the other acceptable size, your file size will be smaller.



This might not be an option if you designed all of your scenes with 720x480 in mind. Plus, 640x480 requires re-rendering, which at this point in time is kinda late.
I don't care what the name of the materials are you made them out of, they're insanely awesome :) Can't wait to see your guys' bot!
Called Autodesk today and they said they were working on it.
Why cant you just connect the box to port 1?


Called Autodesk today and they said they were working on it.




Keep us posted, I hope they figure something out... or I may just skip the hassle of uploading and mail our animation.
Have you checked the pwm signals going into the victors? If the lights on the victors are not solid orange, there is probably a problem with the pwm inputs.
We have 2 assembled and mounted on the bot, and 2 others not assembled.

yes...we are super hyped about our wheels!
One problem you WILL run into is the fact that when you're in the center of the field, the angle of the servos relative to the beacons will be 90 degrees (and the triangulation will fail, as you can't divide by zero  :yikes:
Yeah, I just hope that we don't have to repeat the laborous process of re-uploading everything again.
I was wondering, once the Turn_To_Target state switches to the Drive_To_Target state, what is it supposed to do since Drive_To_Target is blank?  Does that code have to be implemented by ourselves?
Hey.
We have had the same problem. I haven't had the time to try to fix it as it happened to us today and I'm just finding the answers...

One extra question that I have is:
Does anyone know how to prevent this? Or what causes it?
I recieved an e-mail from them today saying that the submissions were moved to make room, they were not deleted and all were accounted for.
Depending on how complex your scene is, maybe not. On the animation I did, it took nearly a week to get everything rendered out (Non-stop renderthon on four computers and it still took a good school-week to be done), so if you're like us, you'd basically be stuck with what you have. I think you can change the physical size of a file in Premiere though.
you don't have to have it I believe...you would just need to have it inline with the part of the circuit (pnuematic) that you want an exact pressure from at any given time.....you can read it out through the dashboard, or use it in your program....gl


Have you checked the pwm signals going into the victors? If the lights on the victors are not solid orange, there is probably a problem with the pwm inputs.




I second that.  A flashing light on the Vicky means its not getting a signal.

Check your PWM connections

If they are fine, take a multimeter and test the cable (we had a couple bad ones this year.  And the cable we incenerated, but thats another story)

Then check programming.

If all that checks out, use a new PWM cable, don't so it neatly, just connect it.  All of our PWM's are ziptied and run behind the board, its hard to keep them straight.  We have had some problems putting them in the right place.

Also, you guys probably have done this a hundred times, but make sure your PWM cables aren't in backwards anywhere.  Double and triple check everything.


Heh, careful when using a three-end PWM cable (you know, that can control 2 spikes or something).  Our programmer was working, using one of those (because it is, well, *was* a spare).  Anyway, the unused end fell into a Vicky.  About two feet of insulation on the cable burned instantly.  Large cloud of white (and probably carcinogenic) smoke.  Thankfully, the victor is fine.

Enough story.  Run the checklist, see if it works.
I assume that you would make a solid peice in order to prevent the clutch from slipping.  If this is the case, then PM me and i will send you instructions on how to weld the clutch and remove the whole spring assembly.
Looking good guys!  Can't wait to see it up close.

I have a couple of questions.  Does the single globe motor control the orientation of all four wheels?  Are you using slip-steering for vehicle rotation?  And, finally, can I play with it?

right, so basically if you have complex scenes, and chose 720x480, you are screwed because of poor rule requirements.


Why cant you just connect the box to port 1?




They can't just hook it to port 1 because if they are using 8 switches they need 8 digital inputs. Port has 8 "inputs" but 4 are analog and 4 are digital. Sorry but I really can't give you answer since I can't really see how your box is wired. My only suggestion is make sure that it you wired the switches to the correct pins.

Make a scene.  Have particles chase a target.  Once successful, have them chase another target at random in the scene.  Do that without a script and with one event.  I want to know how!




Just finished the scene. Took about 3 minutes to set up, and 5 to tune the settings. no scripting, one particle system.

Lemme elaborate James,

We have roughly 130 ft/lbs of torque per wheel, we move at a top speed of about 8 ft/sec. We have plenty of power, but we cannot get the power to the ground, we are doing burnouts and skidding on carpet. We are looking into other wheel options, we are looking at things like gokart slicks and solid urathane skyways.

Thoughts?

-Andy
skyway sells a version of some of its pneumatic wheels where the air tube is replaced by a hard foam insert.  they have excellent traction, but I'm not sure that you can get it with the big wheels (ours our only 6")


Sure.  Its really simple.  Get yourself a 12V SLA battery from an alarm system, or any other battery you happen to have on-hand, a 9v voltage regulator chip, and either buy or cannabalize a plug.  Wire it all together and you have a mobile oi.




I would advise the addition of a voltage divider between the battery and regulator. Otherwise, you might end up with a VERY toasty (and unhappy) 7809.
There is no lip around any of the stationary platforms on the playing field.  The only lip is on the mobile goals.


case DRIVE_TO_TARGET:
case PASSED_TARGET:



the way the "switch" and "case" statements work, the code for PASSED_TARGET is actually executed for both the DRIVE_TO_TARGET state and the PASSED_TARGET state. you see how most "case" statements have a "break" statement at the end? that is to keep the code from the "case"s below from executing - the break statement makes the execution jump to the end of the current block, in this case the "switch". There's no "break" after DRIVE_TO_TARGET, so it just keeps on executing downwards, and thus it's just a shortcut so that both states have the same code.
I believe that the code will cycle as fast as possible, so it really depends on what you have there.
actually, once the robot goes into autonomous mode it's locked into the while(autonomous_mode) loop - anything inside the if(NEW_SPI_DATA) block will cycle approximately (15 / .0262) times.
I missspelt tomorrow once, and the checker told me the correct spelling is gonorrhea - I think it might of been some sort of medical version of the spell checker - this is why I will NEVER let a computer automatically correct my spelling. can you imagine if I had sent an email to someone?

I have heard two conflicting stories on whether or not the PVC in the stationary goals are re-inforced by an internal 1 inch PVC stiffener. I can't find this in the field specs anywhere. Does anyone have the definitive answer????



Dr. Bot,

What led you to believe that there is an internal 1 inch PVC stiffener?

:)

Well I found out why my file size was so huge....I rendered uncompressed in premiere. So I rerendered the final draft and it was 90megs and the quality was appalling.  I think the bad quality is because of rendering in max as a .mov mpeg4 commpression.  However, it puzzles me that the still images, placed in premiere, also have bad image quality.  It should have good quality despite the twicecompressed 3d portions. Please reply to confirm this.

What's an Emu? do you mean EDU?




No Emu, as in emulator.  Rob's RoboEmu is a free downloadable program.  It is a program that basically tests your programming code, without having to use the full control system.  It simulates a control system on your computer.  It's very useful for programming when you dont have a test robot.
... when you are on the bus and you see the nuts being used .. and you automatically know what size wrench they fit into and where exactly on your robot you used the same nuts
That would be really nice.  It would have helped our team a lot in terms of speeding coding up.  Hopefully it will work for next year.  Keep up the good work.

nice bot! just wondering what type of stering you guys were using, b/c our team is using tank turning and we ran into a problem with the pneumatic wheels gripping too much. How did u solve that problem? Can u guys hang?




We do have a turning problem. An hour more of work and we will have replaced the kit wheels with our own custom wheels. We covered the wheels in velcro and then have sets of treads which velcro on. The one we'll probably use has a very low side to side coefficient of friction and a very high forward back coefficient of friction plus his ridges to help climb steps and lips easier. So we are sorta of doing a whole redesign.

The poor traction of the kit wheels were something we took into account when we decided what to make. They're designed for wheechairs which usually have two casters.  The result is that they have a very high side to side friction(just look at the tread). Its going to be a big problem for first teams this years. You can cover one set(forward or back) in a slippery substance and it should allow you to turn, but you'll lose the traction those wheels provide which could cause a problem going up the lip.

As for hanging, we can hang the robot pulled itself off the ground to weigh itself today. We do have a bad habit of breaking a piece of our extender turned out the veclro that the hook sticks to the tip of the extender with was stronger than the extender's wood. So we're hardening that up so we don't have to replace it every match.

Sniff, I'm actually crying, I've never seen a more beautiful robot in recent years then that. I sense you guys are going to be winning a lot of engineering, creativty, and visualization awards for that. If you don't, then it's a $@#$@#$@#$@# shame, because that is truely a work of art.




Can i cry with you man. That is truly a work of art.
Looks Great!!!! Can't wait to see the entire thing when its completed.

Couple questions:

1.  About 4 years ago we used the same type of roller system.  We had problems picking up the balls (they were "lop-sided" back than) because we couldn't get a grip.  Are you just appling pressure, or are you goign to put some type of lining on the rollers?

2. Whats your hopper goign to look like?

3.  Are you goign to be able to catch the balls from the corral?

Looks great guys!! Keep up the good work!
2 Atwood drivetrain
2 drill winch
2 globes to control the bar grabber

and the compressor and a small cylinder for our bar grabber.
yes, they should all be legal - you can add springs to retract the pneumatic cylinders if you want

and you should be able to purchase an off the shelf spring loaded piston device, as long at its not a pneumatic cylinder from 'someone else'
I might be wrong, but I think those are the 2X balls and not the smalls balls.  Are you grabbing both of them and holding them?  Looks nice.  I would like to see a better picture.  Good luck.
It does look like some sort of device to pick up and control the 2x ball. However, as ive seen some teams do this year, it may lower to a point that you can corral balls in the area and push them that way.
Does bimba sell pre-spring loaded pistons?  Because that would be very awesome.  Not that I could use it but I would solve a couple teams problems.
I agree with Ken, following the flow chart, there seems to be nothing wrong with using a Spring Loaded Piston, as long as it does not violate the ruling for custom pneumatic parts.


Does anyone know how to fix this¿¿¿¿¿¿



Well, it's caused by the fact that you're using a variable or function named 'AARGB0' but you never define it anywhere.  It's hard to help more without seeing the code that's using this symbol.
Thank you very much!!  I was able to try it today and now the gyro is working perfectly.  I appreciate your help!
Check the White Papers section also, in the Technical group.
There is a sketch of a layout circuit -
i have about 10 bimba pneumatic cylinders that are 3/4 " stroke 1 1/2" bore. and they are spring loaded in a way. They don't have a second air intake thing but instead just a small hole. We bought them at princess auto for about $2 each. We didn't use them this year just in case they weren't allowed to be used on the robot
Where is the leak? If it is fittings, make sure you used the right wrap of teflon tape and that the fittings are tight.

Also, when you assembled the solenoids, did you use the thin or thick gasket.
Only the thicker one works.

We have not done a full leak check but I don't think we have leaks there.
I think I remember something about not putting your code too deep in directory trees, because the whole directory/filename has to be less than a certain number of characters?

you got your code buried 4 directories deep - I dont know it thats part of your problem - might have something to do with it.

BTW - AARGBO looks like you dropped something on the keyboard while the editor was open :^)



Couple questions:

1.  About 4 years ago we used the same type of roller system.  We had problems picking up the balls (they were "lop-sided" back than) because we couldn't get a grip.  Are you just appling pressure, or are you goign to put some type of lining on the rollers?

2. Whats your hopper goign to look like?

3.  Are you goign to be able to catch the balls from the corral?

Looks great guys!! Keep up the good work!




Thank you for the compliments!  To answer questions without giving away what the robot does....

1. Pressure sounds cool to me.  With my past experiences with rollers, the best way to pick up balls like that is by getting a solid pinch on the ball, and eliminating as much of a sharp curve into the mechanism as possible.

2. eh...hopper?  ;)

3. Well that depends.  I'm sure in some twisted and demented way, we could do it.  But im not betting that we will bother....never say never though!
If you have not yet looked, on usFIRST.org you can go to Download the 2004 FIRST Robotics Competition Manual and Team Updates and about mid way down you will see 2004 field elements-stationary goal-1 and 2. If it is not there than what you hear is most likely not true.


omg... omg... omg...

it took me about 2 min to re-coop from this awsome beauty... the colors are just awsome... the fabrication looks outstanding!!!

so... can it do more than look pretty?! =D




The scorpion transformer feature is pretty cool.   ;)
Not much new in this pic but the re-done wheels are on (still marbles, we will look into the legality and whatnot).

A better shot of the arm in its "being worked on" pose. As you can pretty easily see, both segment of the arm is controlled by a globe, with a spring (thanks to the new rules, all we have to do is convince a judge that it is safe!) which helps the arm (it was in the original design, its not a last minute "oh no, it doesn't work!" add on. The spring's mounts will be beefed up to prevent breakage there. As a safety mechanism we will also run a steel cable through the inside of the spring and anchor it to two places that won't fail if the spring mount gets hit by stray hypersonic projectiles, so that when the spring doesn't break off, it will stay in its position and won't go anywhere.

You can also see the sprocket that drives the rotation of the arm, and you get a better idea at how we did that without a crazy bearing. also visible is the winch, electronics board mounting is more evident. You can see the battery, a better view of our standard drive train, arm workings (other than the spring).

We plan to neaten the wireing to the arm motors, to add cross peices to the arm (although they haven't really been nescessary as of yet. keep your fingers crossed. Again, comments are welcome, but please don't tell us the wheels won't pass inspection if you have already. We've gone over those rules and done tests and don't forsee a conflict, although we will be prepared for one should the inspector decided that our wheels are posessed by Lucifer, the dark lord of all that is not good, himself. And if the judge thinks that they pose feild-damage hazard, we will be ready for that, too.
looks cool :D
Very impressive, as always the green looks super cool!

Is the little piece of metal in front a goal grabber?
is the command sending Pwm4 out to the dashboard before the command that sets it to the joystick value?

search on pwm4 in your code and make sure its not getting equated to something twice.
They can be found on McMaster Carr, they are either 4" or 8" omni wheels, they are so smooth!
The snowhogs are really beefy, but they lift us with ease and they have a lot of traction!
We programmed our last year to extend when we held one button.  Makes it both extend and turns the other solenoid on.  And stop when we let go.  Retract was the same, just on a different button.  As for programming specifics I can't answer anything.
Hey Jeff, just make sure your team doesn't bust into your house and get ya for treason (feds, (ha ha)).

I see belt drive, but is it for the drive?  Or something else????

Double agent Jeff, what information can you tell us (or any other Agents from the FEDS).

Lets ask another question, is that still pvc or is it now a piece of metal...   Tytus, Great robot again and i can wait to see an updatyed video of this bot since the video a few weeks ago...
Anything from Jpop to Korn, lately I'm heavy on classical and dance(I have discovered the joy that is DDR)
Yeah do the make those things in 24" stroke and 2" bores.  Because that would help several teams.  Like 134.


Shouldn't your friend and girl gone for a phone or help or something?  Jeez :P




See, now you're hitting on the realistic side of it.  Now, here's how it would go for me:

I would not give my car keys to my best friend.  The last time I let her drive my car she left the emergency brake on and I, who almost never use it, then drove for 20 minutes with it on and almost ended my life on 495 when my brakes gave out... also, my best friend would probably pass out at the sight of all that blood.  My best friend is an absolute darling, but she would panic if she didn't pass out first.

I would not offer a ride to my "dream" guy.  Hey, 9 out of 10 dreams of mine are nightmares so I'm not betting on those odds... but if those odds were beaten and he was one of the better "dream" guys, why everyone knows the reality never lives up to the fantasy, so why ruin it?

I also would not give a ride to the dying bleeding woman.  I might not know much about first aid, but I know the first thing to do is call 911 and then if you are certified, you may began the rescue procedures you are qualified.  The only time you should move them is if they are in imediate danger from something else.  So, since my CPR certification has lapsed, I would just call 911 and try to keep the injured woman calm.

So when the paramedics get there, I wave goodbye to the bleeding, dying old lady and most likely run like crazy from my "dream" guy... odds say he's the reason she was bleeding and dying anyhow... and I give my best friend a ride only if she promises not to vomit in my car.

swerve drive? Looks like we have tons of those this year!

I thought the 4-wheeled omni would fly before the swerve, though, its simpler (and in my opinion better, but I seem to be in the minority on this one)
Yes it's a simple piston actuated goal grabber, work great. And there's video from tonight posted on the front page of our website http://www.179swampthing.org/
bottom right corner link.
That sounds like a really cool idea, because with a card not only do you have a team number but also a picture of the robot which you could use if you happen to be paired up with that team and you can't remember what that robot did. Question though, how are you making them or are you sending them to a printing company or something?
Talk to your fellow teammate "ToMMan b182" that posts here. It may already be taken care of!!

Wow!  How fast does your bot go?? It zoomed accross the field!
Welcome to Spiffy-ness in design 101.

Today's topic is "Custom CNC Work and the coolness factor of great sponsors and Team Alumni"!!

What do you all think?
its so pretty  :yikes: lol
Oh, sheesh, boys....I have a better idea for a teaser than that :-P


But it looks awesome. :)

What do I think??? I think its really fricken cool!  Great work!!
This appears to just drive one side of the robot.  If thats true, how can you possibly use even 1/2 of the power available to you here?  Wouldnt your draw much more than 120 amps with the six biggest motors running simulataneously and then say... trying to push something immovable?  Can your wheels utilize this much power?
Final Review was this Monday.

It as a Production Readiness / Operational Readiness Review.

If we were building a turbine engines...
For the Production Readiness Review, we would have focused on our supply chain, manufacturing facilities, parts releases, quality systems, etc. The review would have been to insure that we were ready for full scale production.
For the Operational Readiness Review, we would have focused on field service support, repair facilities, operating manuals, overhaul manuals, and spare parts availability.

But, since we are building 1 robot, our focus was a bit different.

We first showed that the robot we have designed and are building met our requirements. We focused on our "internal requirements", but could have also stepped through the FIRST requirements as well. For each of our requirements, we tried to show proof that we met the requirement - either proven by design data or from demonstrated testing.

The operational readiness focused on the competition capability of the robot. Was it durable and robust, could it take the stress of competition, did we have spare parts ready, and such.

We had the robot partially disassembled so we could not drive for them, but we did show video from the week before.

To close the review we received comments from the reviewers on our process and ways they saw to improve the process of what we were doing. Overall they were very positive.

Our next step is to complete a matrix of complaince to our requriemetns and to continue to review our risk register as we go into the final weekend.

Another unexpected plus form this review was through a new sponsor. We have added Allison Transmission (GM) as a sponsor this season. One of the Engineering Managers was a part of our Technical Advisory Team and he attended most of the reviews. We gained from his involvement, and he has a better understanding of the FIRST program by really being a part of our build process. It was truly a win - win situation.

No more reviews - we have an open house Monday for the community, school, sponsors and others. The TAC will be there and hope to see a fully functional robot driving around, and "hanging around" a bit, also!

this has been done before, your motors dont have as much load on them when they are in a gearbox like that, coupled with other motors. The share the load. Also this might be a problem becuase of the extended use of motors this year but i doubt it. I hope it works out for these guys, and yes they will use that power to bully the 2-motor drives around  :p
Awesome awesome.  :cool:  :D
It happens on all programs that I try to compile, even the default code I redownloaded from First to check it. And it isin't the directory structure, because it does the same thing from root directorys.     :confused:

The one I posted was just opens and compiled quick to get the error message htat keeps coming up.

And the term AARGB0 gets 152 hits on Google about byte lengths for programing.

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=AARGB0


It just says it is for giving you a presure readout, it doesn't say if you need it or not.




We have left ours off.   We don't plan to monitor the system pressure so it would be a waste to incorporate it.
I can honestly say I've never been so happy to not see the wings of terror.  I am intrigued through.  I was close to e-mailing you to see if we could learn about what super bot your team is creating this year.  Can you give us any specs or more hints.  The website has nothing new to offer so do you.  I'll show you mine if you show me yours (or I would if I had access to a picture) but I could at least release some details in private.  I'm interested to see the rest of it.  I won't make it to Houston so good luck and be nice to 1108 with your bot.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to stop by your pits in Atlanta.  I can't wait.
&lt;me&gt; totally lost...&lt;/me&gt;

Sorry dude...
And for those of you that are completly lost I've done us all a favor and searched it up on Google (thank you google, w/o you my life would be horrible)

This is the spacecraft designed by Burt Rutan.

[Info on Rutan](http://www.isepp.org/Pages/02-03%20Pages/Rutan.html)

[SpaceShip One Info](http://http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=9986)

:)
Sorry, I wasn't very clear.  SpaceShip One is a program (and a vehicle) designed by Burt Rutan.  He's trying to build the first privately-owned system to get a pilot and 2 passengers into space.  He's built 2 vehicles.  One, called the White Knight, is a weird airplane.  It straddles the other (called SpaceShip One) and lifts it into the air.  When they're high enough, SpaceShip One uses a rocket engine to fly into space.  They then land like airplanes.
I had them left over from my computer so I gave them to the team.  I got them off of svc.com($1.79), but most computer modding sites carry them.  If you are looking for single LEDs, though, I would check out [LS Diodes](http://www.lsdiodes.com).  They have the highest quality LEDs at the lowest prices.
True this has been done before. We did last year. No blown fuses, just broken chains. Using 35 chain this year with some improvements.


I never saw any such control thing in the code - where is it?  And doesn't this require that the compressor and switch be wired up in a very specific way?  I fail to see how this works...



You are free to add anything you want to the code. :)
well assuming two motor limited 2+ motor robots get into a pushing match.  Their current draw can sky rocket to over 450 amps for a drill+chip or nearly 600 for this beast!  Now what i was imagining is this robot locks its motors. I dont know the specific types of breakers used, but its possible to destroy stuff before something blows. if they dont have all the breakers working properly, they could probably melt even the 6 gauge wire itself pretty quickly.

I understand that locking the drivetrain is unlikely with so much power (unless of course a screw driver some how gets jammed in there  ;)  )  But regardless, three motors seems useless. Basically, i dont understand why anything more than a drill and an FP is needed because when running both at max power, the total current draw is already pushing 130 or so.  Why design something that has a maximum power that you cant even utilize.  Also, three motors must introduce a very large amount of ineffeciencies because of motor curves not matching.

Because of the proliferation of 2 and 3 drive systems, I must have something very wrong in my analysis, or maybe i have discovered the key to the perfect drivetrain  :D
This is just a list of things I would check:

Are the 40 amp breakers are tripping?

Is the clutch in the drill motor locked into high or low gear?

Is possibly gears slipping and not making contact?

Are the drills set to the same gear on both sides (ie.. high/high or low/low)?

Is cooling efficient? Are the drill motors over heating at all? They tend to like to do that.
I was just wondering... What kind of paint did you use? and how did you do it?
The University of Alabama sponsored a programming contest that I've particpated in (and won) ... but it was a live event (in person). Their prizes were a $2000 scholarship for first place and a $1000 scholarship for second place. The moral of the story is that I found that it was more than worth my $20 entry fee. :D)
Now, if you just had one of those in each corner at 45 degree angles....
One big problem is alinement and binding. In you wheels are binding then your motors have to work really hard to do anything. Tryrunning with wheels off the ground and see what happens. If your are still popping breakers then there is a deffinate problem with friction somewhere.
Those are so cool.
Whats the rest of it look like? :D

I'm the first:

maxlobovsky, your concerns are right that the "theoratical" current draw of their robot will be very high, coupled with their spikes, e.t.c it might even be 500 AMP. But will they ever hit tht point?, i mean  if there are in a pushing match against someone who has a 2 motor drivetrain, whose fuse will reset first? the 2 motor drive train because it has more load on individual motors. The motor curves can be  very accurately matched with some testing and good programming, basically making tables and having different values at different point for the motors so they run on almost same RPMs always. Also if there is a very minor different its unnoticeable, and because they are not using the transmission on their drill, all are raw DC motors, they will help each other, not overlaod each other.

Though it would be interesting to see them go against someone with 3 motor drive. They both might reset their breakers  ;).
Happy B-Day John.
Cool Design!

Do You guys plan on going for the 10pt. balls to release the 5pt'ers or are you guys just gonna hang and mess with the 2x balls.

I've updated my post slightly.  What im really saying is that it is useless to sue the 6 biggest motors when you could get essentially the same effective power out of 2 motors (and not even the drill and chip).  Of course they may be trying to keep their motors in the most efficient part of the curve, but all the extra stuff that this drivetrain requires (bigger, heavier gearbox, more wiring and controller, etc) probably kills that gain in efficiency
I've seen a number of teams using multiple motors for their drive system this year. Personally, I don't see this game as being like last year and being 1 big shoving match. I think that even a simply drive system using a very simple motor will be fine. However, This drive train looks immense. Looks like the Fisher Price motor, Drill, and Atwood. This must be one of the fastest and most powerful robots i have seen so far this year.

In that case, I'll bet there's a problem with your compiler install.  I just checked, and this symbol is included in clib.lib (from the MPLAB install).  Check for this file on your system.  You might also consider reinstalling MPLAB into a different directory.
Okay....Does anyone think mpeg4 compression would be considered unacceptable or "nonstandard"?  The rules say: 'Acceptable Codecs:DV-NTSC and Cinepak. Do not use DIVX or any other non-standard Codec.'  Does that mean only DV-NTSC and Cinepak are acceptable or are DV-NTSC and Cinepak only examples of acceptable codecs.
Very nice bot. I see a pneumatic system at the base of the tower. Is this to be able to have the tower go parallel to your bot and be able to herd balls?
lol, that is great.  I think im going to have robot nightmares...

I totally agree with you, i am sure they have their own reasons for doing that. But i just wanted to get it clear that it gives you some superiority in you drivetrain. Though you might have to compropise a bit on your arm or lifter, unless you use a clutch, but that would need a lot of experience.
We were able to accomplish an omni-wheel-like effect today without the use of omnis.  It's so good, I can't really say yet how we did it.  What I can say is that we maintain fairly good forward traction while suberbely reducing sideways traction.
Considering they are asking us to render TV size and with TV compressions, yes, anything but the two listed would be considered non-standard.

let me guess, wrap it in something?  There are a couple of good materials that we have tried, also....
It worked well with us last year with Blizzard 4 although last year we broke a chain every few matches... But we might see some pushing matches like last year's...
The image of the gearbox is pretty much to scale about an inch give or take...


...Though you might have to compropise a bit on your arm or lifter, unless you use a clutch, but that would need a lot of experience.




I'm just gonna say, we're overweight (counting in battery and everything) and finding stuff to drill out/sand down... But thanks to our genius we've got this gearbox together to work perfectly...
OMG....

u guys got it to work.  Amazing.  If it works like last years in the slightest way.....u will win big.  Many teams have no idea how much speed and power these guys had last year.


**Happy Birthday JVN!**





Ditto. :)

depends on your monitor

I guess i can't really argue about drivetrains until i get more experience. Its just that i dont understand why my analysis is incorrect.
i remember and look forward to meet them again this year, their robot was great only the yellow delphi and the little blue robot with cross bars had power to match theirs
There's a few obvious double checks you need to do:

You need to use the spacers they give you to keep you gear aligned, they work well if you use them properly. Without them, the helical gears will be a nightmare. With proper spacers, you can assume almost zero losses. Ours out of the box were very fluid. If you need to make some, purchase a pair of digital calipers ($20 off eBay) and get them accurate relative to the gear box. Poorly meshed gears can make or break a drivetrain.

The other obvious gearing troubles:

Do you have your helical gears made such that you're slowing down through the gear box (as opposed to speeding up?) If this isn't the case, you may need too much current from your drill motors.

It'd be easiest if I had a picture of your robot, perhaps you could IM or email me so we can talk more. I'm extremely sympathetic to getting drivetrain issues resolved for student run teams, and am more than willing to talk you through some solutions.

Good luck!

1 fp - Winch

7 motors

2 servos, maybe 1 more? - Autonomous

1 pneumatic cylinder  - arm
2 pneumatic cylinders - Goal Grabbers
2 pneumatic cylinders - Ball herders.



as well as (1) compresser and (2) pistons. what great fun in the code...  . 5 victors in 1.5 sq feet with 3 spikes and that new fuse block wasnt easy.



On a 22*10 in plate, we fit 1 compressor, 4 solonoids, 5 spikes, 2 air tanks, 5 victors, a winch mechanism, and the circut breaker panel.  The secret is ... well, it will be revealed later (pretty obvious).
Efficiency is a huge thing when it comes to drive trains.  You have to make sure that your holes where the shafts mount are drilled straight, and that everything aligns properly.  If it does not, it is definitely worth the time to redo whatever part that may be and fix the problem.  This may not be the easiest thing to do, but you will be glad you did it in the long run.  Make sure you are locked in the right position, make sure you are aligned, right tension in chain, no wheel slippage.  Also, if you have the current sensors installed, then use them to the full advantage!  Run a dashboard and see what kind of numbers you are pulling when the breakers trip, that way, you can setup your gear ratios to match that current output, and won't trip the breakers.  I am an electronics guy myself, so this is why i suggest this route.  If you are tripping because of the wrong gear ratios used in your drive, see where the breaker trips, and then calculate the gear ratio such that you cannot pull that much current and thus not trip your breaker.

Good luck!!

For 'teasing' hair.. not bot related.



you deserve a dew or somthing
we are also a second year team, we tried the same direct drive that you are talking about, but we got some time to test it and we also tried it on carpet and up the ramp and got that jerky motion. We then found out it was our 40 AMP breakers. Once we had to problem narrowed down, we found out that the shafts were perfectly alligned. Things to make sure, all shafts are straight, the more perfect the better. Also they shafts on motors should be secured by some bearings, block bearins if you ask me. Than your wheel shafts should be perfectly alligned, with a mechnaism that allows you to tenion yor chain.

So basically,
Shafts should be alligned perfectly, the chains should be right tension not too much, but also not too little and also i would never recommend gearing up, always gear down.

Now the gear boxes you talk about, if they are not custom than you may not run into that much problems but if they are custom makes sure to have accurate measuring equipment that allows you to be precise to atleast 1/200 of an inch. Also have the spacers ready, make sure no component in the gear box is allowed to have any play(move).

Last but not least make sure the gears dont bind, the best way of checking this is, put a piece of paper and mesh your gears if the peice of papers slids through easily tht means you have a clearence of 4/1000 inch which is optimum for helicul gears. Also make sure you dont have that much of a slip, the lesser the better. Slip means that you have a little bit of movement between your gears, this can cause additional friction you may not want.

Also did you work out the speed you want to be going on and the RPM you want before you designed the gearbox?.

Also if you dont understand sitll, PM me and i'll spend some time on MSN with you snd walk you through all the parts and we might find out what is causing the poblem.
man thats a brilliant picture. kudos goes out to that photographer
Nice robot... I see you're gonna use window motors to move the 2x ball and globes to move the arms... But the thing that puzzles me is the use of the van door motor, which I supose is to somehow with some device go up on the 10ft pull up bar.
There's a question though, does the arm have enough strength that the globe motors won't stall or backwind when lifting up the 3 pound 2x ball?
The arm has positional control so we can set it to a position and it will stay there. This allows us to hit the ball on the stand. We've also got light sensors on the bottom so we can do it accuratly.

The pneumatic system at the base of the tower is to allow it to have 2 positions. We have one angled up and back a bit and another down at about 60 degrees. This allows us flexibility without the complexities of having to have the arm powered by a motor(which we did last year). The arm doesn't need to drop down since we have the wings which pop out the side and we need to protect our ball grabber.

Benthos!!!
Looks like your drawing too much current and causing some arching.


Just kiddin! Nice!!! I have some EL wire i was thinking of putting on the bot.


and you should be able to purchase an off the shelf spring loaded piston device, as long at its not a pneumatic cylinder from 'someone else'




Spring-loaded pistons are NOT legal.  Review the fourth paragraph of &lt;R54&gt;  and the parts-use flowchart (including the expanded flowchart in Rules Update #10) VERY carefully.

Is a spring-loaded piston an air cylinder ordered from the Custom Cylinder Order Form?  No.

Is it a purchased cylinder or actuator **IDENTICAL** to those available on the Custom Cylinder Order Form?  No.

Spring loaded pistons are not available on the order form in the pneumatics manual.  Therefore, you cannot purchase pistons that are spring loaded.

We also had similar problems with our robot going crazy with the tracking code...but then we realized our IR sensors weren't plugged in.  But FYI, i think servos are supposed to plug in to PWMs 3 and 4.  Your robot was going crazy because the pwm values were switching back and forth because the program thought they were servos and was sweeping the field with them... :rolleyes:

i had tht hunch dont know if it is true, but can you please point out where the motors will go than..i mean drive motors
I stand corrected, I did not see the updated Flow Chart in this team update, I apoligize.
if i am right arent we allowed to use springs this year?, than why not attach the spring seperately to that part your piston is going to be on, and the whole thing will act as a spring loaded piston
Our robot 2 years ago was left in a leaky truck outside in rainy Seattle. Needless to say, when we unscrewed the crate, water came spilling out. Thank goodness our electronics and motors were not hurt. However, much of the metal on the bot was rusted.

Last year we tarped and saran-wrapped the robot inside the crate. This year we will do 2 layers of plastic, one on the inside, and the other on the outside.


But we might see some pushing matches like last year's...




I agree we might see some pushing matches, but they will be minimal at most. With the way the game was designed last year, a lot for teams figured it would be like battle bots from the begginning. It turned out they were right. With the Hill having 25 points (don't really remember), it was obvious a lot of teams would try for this, and they did. That meant keeping other teams off to optimize points.

However this year, reminds me of 2001? I'm not sure which one, but it was the year with the ramp and balancing the 2 goals. It seems like FIRST looked at the game this year, and realized they were going in the wrong direction. Looking at how the game is described and going to be played, it seems like pushing will be at very minimal.

I am not saying pushing will not be a factor, because it will in very rare instances. This game is more about strategy and robot effectiveness, not so much brute strength. Adding the 2x ball and the maneuvers it take, is very reminiscent of past FIRST games, which it seems like they are going back to, which I'm glad to see.
I'm pretty sure this would be legal, seeing as how you're not modifying the piston itself in anyway.
I believe the purpose of shrink-wrapping the crate this year, is to be sure it was not tampered with in anyway. I'm just wondering if FIRST will have the ability to shrink wrap at the events, for teams who are shipping to another event.
I agree, very nice omni wheels this year. Some of the nicest ones I have seen in many recent years actually. Very nice work!

Once again, a very impressive robot by 179. It only gets better every year, I love it!
Yeah, it would be legal but a manufactured one would be better in this case because it is designed to work in this way but a team designed one might be more dangerous.  A pre-built one would be easier to implement into the system too.  Too bad, the rule is clear now.  Just make sure your spring loaded device doesn't break the 10 ft/sec rule.
Congratulations to Woburn for once again creating a fabulous gearbox.  For those who aren't familiar with team 188, this will be their third consecutive year using a six motor drive system. The addition of the shifter makes them even more dangerous.

How has it been performing during the testing?  Has the new chain held up well?

I look forward to facing you guys in Pittsburgh and Toronto.  Wow, it sure will be weird being on the other side.

Chris Noble made a wise choice to move to 1018.  I have commissioned a scout to get me more photos  :D

One thing that i think might increase the value of the reputation system is to value everybody's opinions equally.  In other words, a negative rep from somebody with 5 reputation points should be worth just as much as a negative rep from somebody with 5000 reputation points.  The way it is set up now, people who are new or have not been noticed yet have almost no say in reputation.  In FIRST, everybody should have an equal opportunity to listen and critisize (constructively of course).

Also, I think it might be a good idea to make the comment mandatory for all approves or dissaproves.  The comment can be very valuable in learning what somebody did wrong and how to fix it.  Again, this is the idea of constructive critisism.

Overall, I do like the system, but these improvements along with the exclusion of certain forums should help to reform the system.
**Happy Birthday JVN!**

Yeah, thats about it. Back to paper-writing I go....
Ian,

Add a single solenoid to your exhaust of the solenoid for your tower tilt and you can have several positions instead of two.

Check out this thread to see how:

[http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23934](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23934)

I think it would be helpful and it would only cost you a 1/4 lb of weight and some extra programming for control of the angle of your tower.  This would be helpful both when climbing stairs and when manipulating the 2X ball.  If you have any questions about multi-positioning just ask.  We did this last year and it worked great.
Hey great work, i noticed that the first screen , the building in there looks very simmilar to the library model in the tutorial of 3D Max 6. Are we allowed to use those models?
:yikes: Your site is awesome!  After browsing the site for awhile I've found only one fault.  Try and clean up the FIRST Canadian Regional logo at:

Shrink-wrapping and/or banding your crate is a new requirement by all cargo shippers.  This is not unique to FIRST, it is just the first time we have had to deal with it.

It is a direct off-shoot from the idiot that FedEx'd himself from New York to Houston (or where ever it was) a few months ago.  The experience made shipping companies nervous, when they realised the implications of that experience (i.e. if a person can ship themselves acrosss country without being noticed, what else could they ship?).

-dave
Nice solid frame!!  Gotta love the no chain...


One question, is that masking tape??  :confused:
Yes, tape keeps our gearboxes clean.

And yes, that is my shoe in the top right corner.
The tape was there so we wouldnt get chips in the gearboxes. I forgot to take them off when i was taking the picture.   i
How heavy are they?
I saw that and was thinking of adding it but the main idea of using the pneumatic instead of a motor was not for the weight but instead because we wanted to keep it simple. We don't need any more positions and so having them will only get in the way.

Presently we're programming the arm so that it will automatically go to positions such as to place the ball in a goal or pick one up off the ground. It does 90 degrees in about .3 seconds so having it under computer control should allow us to go much faster than human controlled teams.

We might work on the multipositional thing after competition but for now we really don't need it.

What kind of bastard friends would that person have? "Oh.. there's someone dying here.. but I have MORE IMPORTANT plans."  And if their plans are important.. why are they waiting for the bus!?  Also, if I'm driving a two-seater.. I don't think I'd want some old-lady blood all over the interior.. THINK OF THE CARS, PEOPLE!


I wave goodbye to the bleeding, dying old lady and most likely run like crazy from my "dream" guy... odds say he's the reason she was bleeding and dying anyhow...




Haha!  Best laugh I've had in a while :)

You know, you could easily solve that problem if you were deeply in love with your best friend, a 70 year-old woman.
I would suggest a different font on the menus.  Everything else seems to be good.  The flash was good, but very slow.  I imagine you guys are running it from a box at home.  Try uncapping the limit your isp has set ;) or get t1.
The cool thing about it is that you don't have to use it.  You can have a switch which will turn it off or allow you to use it or disabling it completely involve removing a piece of tubing.  It's just an idea if you ever need that mid position with the 2x ball.  So I decided to throw it out there.  If you want any help with it just ask.  And you can make some very simple controls for it.  Our system was you held one button to make it go out, and one to go in.  If you let go of the button somewhere in the middle it would stop.  But good luck whatever route you choose.  It looks good.

Do something like this:


unsigned char state = 0;
unsinged char switchState = 0;

// Check switches. Substitute switch for whatever switch on the OI you are using
// I use the switch state to prevent the switching of the state do to not realeasing the button right away
if(switch && !switchState)
{
// Set switch state
swtichState = 1;

// Switch states
if(switch)
state = 0;
else
state = 1;
}
else if(!switch)
{
// reset the switch state
switchState = 0;
}

// Subitute relay with your relay
if(state)
{
// Run forward
relay_fwd = 1;
relay_rev = 0;
}
else
{
// Turn off relay
relay_fwd = 0;
relay_rev = 0;

Put that whole thing where ever you are doing your cheking currently. Put the varable declarations at the top of whatever function you have this in. That should work. (I hope... ;))
That is a good point test and make some major changes, for some odd reason i think there will be a meeting sunday a very long meeting. LOL

We also do not believe that there will be tons of pushing. Speed and precision are what will be important. Shifting gears will allow both. If and when power is needed ......  If you think that pushing will not be important, what would you be doing if someone where trying to uncap your goal or cap theirs for the win?


I think I remember something about not putting your code too deep in directory trees, because the whole directory/filename has to be less than a certain number of characters?

you got your code buried 4 directories deep - I dont know it thats part of your problem - might have something to do with it.

BTW - AARGBO looks like you dropped something on the keyboard while the editor was open :^)


Just for the record, the character limit is 64. :)

Yeah, try reinstalling MPLAB. Uninstall it first, then look at the PATH enviroment variable and delete any reference to the compiler or anything. Our team has found that it is incredibly picky about being first in the list (we don't know why) and not having any other references to itself. (If you don't know how to view your path, type "msconfig" in a run dialog. Click on the enviroment tab in the window that appears.) After that fun, you can then try reinstalling MPLAB.


What's an Emu? do you mean EDU?


Click on the link in his signature to visit his website and see his stuff. It's mostly for the old controllers, however.

Hope that the Microchip is ultra-helpful. :):)
Nice robot, and I'm glad you guys are going to Nationals this year.  I kind of expected a super POed robot from you guys this year, since last year's robot took up the entire ramp and is constently angrified.
Are you using basicly the default code? Or did you rewrite the Default_Routine? Check below the pwm assignments, and comment out the stuff with pwm04. I had the same problem, and that fixed it. I think its limit switches, but I can't remember.
Yes, That is simlest.

Our idea was using a pot for 'Target' position and using a sensor with 2 solenoids to make it stop.
Like:


Const Arm_Upper_Stop as Unsigned Int = 150
const Arm Upper_Catch as unsigned int = 140
Const Arm_Upper_Range as Unsigned Int = 130
Const Arm_Target as Unsigned Int = 125
Const Arm_Lower_Range as Unsigned Int = 120
const Arm_Lower_Catch as Unsigned Int = 110
Const Arm_Lower_Stop as Unsigned Int = 100

void inter_ArmSensor(void)
{
Static iPrevValue as unsigned int

//Continue after catchup
if (iPrevValue >= Arm_Upper_Stop & ArmSensor < Arm_Upper_Catch)
{ArmMotor_Go;}
if (iPrevValue <= Arm_Lower_Stop & ArmSensor > Arm_Lower_Catch)
{ArmMotor_Go;}

//Emergancy Stops
if (ArmSensor >= Arm_Upper_Stop)
{ArmMotor_Stop;}
if (ArmSensor <= Arm_Lower_Stop)
{ArmMotor_Stop:}

//Start Cylinder
if (ArmSensor >= Arm_Upper_Range)
{ArmCylinder_Out;}
if (ArmSensor <= Arm_Lower_Range)
{ArmCylinder_In;}

//Stop Cylinder
if (ArmSensor < Arm_Upper_Range)
{ArmCylinder_Stop;}
if (ArmSensor > Arm_Lower_Range)
{ArmCylinder_Stop;}
}


But I have a more efficient idea. ;)


Team 1189 is cursed when it comes to drill motors.

But now, when we drive the robot around the shop, the familiar jerking control and clicking of the breakers has returned! It makes all of us in the shop (except the drive train person) scream for use of CIM's, if only for their extreme simplicity from the outside! I mean, so many things can go wrong with the drill motors: Are the pins okay? Is the clutch engaged? High/Low gear? Brushes bent? Solder joints weak? Those thick black Korean cylinders look mighty tempting when all you have to decide is 'broken, or not?'.





Well you have a lot of good suggestions so far.  I would add a few more.
1. Are you using tank steering?  (i.e. steering is accomplished solely through the drive motors and no tires turn to steer.) If so can you drive straight up and back without tripping the breakers?  Turning produces incredible friction on the drive train and any friction is translated into high current.

2.  Have you removed the drill motors and tried turning the drive system by hand?  If you can't do this then the parts are not aligned as well as you think.  Make sure the shafts, pillow blocks, and bearings are all running true.  The right angle helical drive must be at perfect right angles for you to minimize friction there.  My suggestion is to rebuild the drive starting at the wheels.  Get the wheels turning freely before adding the next drive component, get that in alignment and add the next componenet one at a time until you get the drill and transmission mounted up.

3.  Are you asking the drive to go too fast?  With big wheels on the robot you may need to slow the speed down in software to compensate for the large wheel.  Another alternative is to select the low speed on the transmission.  I would trade speed for reliable operation any day.  You can't play if you can't play!
yay! i can't wait... i used RoboEmu last year whenever i was programming, and now i cant do without it :confused:
I heard the 'pro' stiffener view from a FIRST board member who was on the game design committee.  I heard the 'con' version from a FIRST regional co-ordinator. The reason I want to know is the stationary goals as built are pretty floppy and it is possible to throw small balls through them, accidently knock small balls out, jam the big ball so far down the goal that it can be a problem resetting the field.  Also I am afraid that it will be pretty easy to shatter the unreinforced PVC unintentially during vigorous game play.  I think it is a reasonable question.


There is no lip around any of the stationary platforms on the playing field.  The only lip is on the mobile goals.




Then if there is no lip on the edges of the platforms, does the diamond plating go all the way to the top so it is flush against the HDPE or does the HDPE hang over the diamond plating?


Wow, it sure will be weird being on the other side.


You and Ian can always do something about that you know :) . your swerve/strafe drive is pretty freaking impressive too.

Thanks everyone for the commentary. Let me just address a few things. First, you are all welcome to take a look at the regionals, I'd be happy to explain it, and get into an argument as to why it'll work :) . From experience, we have found that blowing breakers is very rare, and in fact we never did last year, despite having a non-shifting three-motor box. While there are hungrier F-Ps this year, we believe the ability to shift in conjunction with the backup battery keeping our controller on, will allow us to not overtax ourselves in matches. **max** is absolutely correct in saying that the three motors should not peak, because their current draw at that level is far higher than the motors will ever take. The gears are optomized and mated in such a way that something near the peak efficiency of each motor is used. The current is equally distributed*.* As a result, we will be able to get slightly more pushing power at the same amount of draw, divided over three motors; it won't be a full 'motor's worth' more, but it'll be enough to seriously mess with teams that thought they were powerful. According to the current curves, after about 10-15 seconds at stall in high gear, our robot will probably nuke itself, but we do not expect this to happen in normal match activities. It was also mentioned that versus a two-motor gearbox, we are not overtaxing our breakers, but the other robot will be. We will prevail. Bottom line, six-motor drive is a tried and true method for Woburn (although I have seen two other teams do it). Ask anyone at West Michigan or Toronto and they'll agree. Just *try* pushing us.

As it happens, we don't believe a huge amount of pushing will occur this year. That doesn't mean in our minds that we shouldn't be able to do it. Maybe more on the gearbox later from the source, but we'd like to keep a little mystery :) .
I scanned my hard drive and I coulden't find any file with AARGB0 in it, not including history for google searches. the last thing I can thing of is the CD is corrupted. It has happened on the computer I use in school, my home computer, and the other programmers computer when he tried it last night.

Can anyone send me the clib.lib file¿¿¿ and the path it is installed in¿¿¿

Also, I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling several times and it still does the same thing :(
Nice work.

I like the quick facts idea. One problem at the top right of the page for me it shows just a white blank space. Is that supposed to be like that? If so I suggest adding putting something to fill the gap.

Otherwise I really like :-)
Thanks.

We have spent a bit of timing ensuring that it will do well at the Canadian Regional. Constantly upgrading, re-vamping and adding.

Yeh the logo on the workshop page does need to be fixed, I will keep that in mind.

The FIRST logo was taken from the original FIRST logo off the FIRST Canadian Regional website, so I should be fine. Do I have to get the minimized and whitened version of the FIRST approved? Really?

Well actually the Flash will work fast on faster computers. I have a 1GHz system and it works perfectly. As for hosting, our school has its own IT department that setup a computer specifically for hosting with Windows Server 2003 Web Edition on a T2 line :-p No home computer hosting for us :-p

I will see about upgrading the hardware to make it faster.

Thanks,

The colors are fine right? Not to dark not too light? Colours mesh properly? No gaps in the design?
I never get a splash page for my b-day  :(   ;)  :p

swerve drive? Looks like we have tons of those this year!

I thought the 4-wheeled omni would fly before the swerve, though, its simpler (and in my opinion better, but I seem to be in the minority on this one)



Im suprised there isnt more simple Omni drives, as opposed to the more difficult Crab and Serve
We've actually done one of those, but I don't remember if it was this year or last.  Either way, I'll scan and post it later tonight!

Well, now I'm excited to go into the shop again!

I'm going to show all of your replies to the other guys, and possibly PM one of you guys if we can't figure it out.

Only 45 minutes until I can mess with that pretty robot again...
You could use one of the magnectic sensor actuators from bimba and control the cyclinder based on the position of the piston throw.  That would be simple and super efficient.  I don't know how much more these cyclinders weigh but I doubt it could be much.
Just wondering why you have to ship today? Also, is that bathroom scale really that accurate for all of that weight you have distributed all over the place?

Just curious
Nathan Pell
wow, i'm impressed, you got the robot done in enough time to test robot hits, and you manufactured multiple arms, all I can say is, wow (again)

I'm in awe... :eek:
We have to ship today because we have a big holiday coming soon (carnival), and it´s 3 to 4 days holiday... I really hate carnival and everything related to it... everything stops working, everything closes for days...

Still there´s a chance that our bot doesn´t arrive to the US in the due time to compete.
They are from Brazil and competing at one of the first regional when they go to NJ.  Things take longer to ship international.  Especially when they aren't priority.  I was wondering if you guys have to put up your own shipping cost or if everyone gets free shipping.  That would be a huge cost for you guys if they didn't.  And yeah, I don't know how accurate that scale would be.  It was definitely tilted to one size.  I hope it was right and good luck in NJ.
That i just amazing you got it done that fast! I am really impressed!

I was just wondering...... can I be a part of the FART CREW?!?!?!



2. Why is it Disney's liability at all?  If I bring a Segway in and run someone over, hit someone, break someone's leg, or do something else, I would think that I would be the only one liable...

But IANAL...





You wouldn't be the only one liable because they're legally responsible for anything that happens on their property.  Thanks to the world of bogusly ridiculous, get-rich-quick lawsuits, Disney could get sued for a heck of a lot of money.  I think we now all need to thank the lady who sued for coffee that's too hot.

I concur.  In addition to all your comments I will add that it is almost impossible to trip the main breaker with the battery we have -- really.

As to whether 3 motors per side with a shifting transmission is needed, that is a topic for another discussion.  Awesome job of engineering regardless of whether or not you acually need all that power.

Did you change the PATH like I suggested?


Our programmer has been working from day one.  We switched out RC's on last years bot and he has programmed several options for competition.  It takes more time to switch the battery on our robot than it would to make a new program.

Work from week one and you won't need the extra time.





RAGE has for a long time now made two robots that were as identical as possible.  We are also lucky enough to have a space donated to our team in which we can build a full size playing field every year and we have always been willing to open it up to other teams in the area if they wanted practice.  All you would have to do is ask our team leader Mr. Nystrom and he would be willing to set something up with your team.  I have found that have the second bot gives your drivers a feel for the robot, but not always an advantage.  Last year we still had mechanical issues that were not encountered while practicing, like our arm chains breaking all the time.  So just becuase you are able build a second robot doesn't mean you are able to account for everything that might happen on the field at a competition.  And it definately doesn't prepare a rookie team or a rookie drive team in general for the pressure placed on them during a real life competition.


Yes, That is simlest.

Our idea was using a pot for 'Target' position and using a sensor with 2 solenoids to make it stop.
Like:


Const Arm_Upper_Stop as Unsigned Int = 150
const Arm Upper_Catch as unsigned int = 140
Const Arm_Upper_Range as Unsigned Int = 130
Const Arm_Target as Unsigned Int = 125
Const Arm_Lower_Range as Unsigned Int = 120
const Arm_Lower_Catch as Unsigned Int = 110
Const Arm_Lower_Stop as Unsigned Int = 100

void inter_ArmSensor(void)
{
Static iPrevValue as unsigned int

//Continue after catchup
if (iPrevValue >= Arm_Upper_Stop & ArmSensor < Arm_Upper_Catch)
{ArmMotor_Go;}
if (iPrevValue <= Arm_Lower_Stop & ArmSensor > Arm_Lower_Catch)
{ArmMotor_Go;}

//Emergancy Stops
if (ArmSensor >= Arm_Upper_Stop)
{ArmMotor_Stop;}
if (ArmSensor <= Arm_Lower_Stop)
{ArmMotor_Stop:}

//Start Cylinder
if (ArmSensor >= Arm_Upper_Range)
{ArmCylinder_Out;}
if (ArmSensor <= Arm_Lower_Range)
{ArmCylinder_In;}

//Stop Cylinder
if (ArmSensor < Arm_Upper_Range)
{ArmCylinder_Stop;}
if (ArmSensor > Arm_Lower_Range)
{ArmCylinder_Stop;}
}


But I have a more efficient idea. ;)


If anyone uses that make sure to change the Consts to lowercase. (Horrible error, Astronouth. ;))
I have 4 of the rear plastic support peices and need 2 of the middle.

If anyone has 4 of the middle and need 2 rear let me know.
That is one of the best teasers I have seen. Great picture.


We've actually done one of those, but I don't remember if it was this year or last.  Either way, I'll scan and post it later tonight!

PS.  Arent they cool????



RAGE has also done cards like this in the past. I will bring it up to my team to see if they would be willing to make modifications to this card and we can pass them out up here.
Yes, reading from right to left does make things interesting. I did pick up a manga book once and I had previously thought myself good a reading comic books even though I don't read them much. But when I found out that they did it japanese style (right to left) I was often confused. :yikes: Oh well.


How heavy are they?


About 2 pounds each. ... my beautiful babies !!!
I don't know if my team took care of that or not but their e-mail is [email]panthers1108@yahoo.com[/email] .  They had me post earlier to try to solve this problem but I don't know what they have done since and I don't go home until tommorow.  They did need two rear mount and could trade two middle mounts.  But you would have to check.
Very nice.  I too have become good friends with a cnc machine.  Look for interesting things on the RAGE bot this year.  Some was CNC'ed and some Laser cut because an alumni now working with the team has access to many laser cutters at work.


Does anyone have a working Tracker code that we could borrow to see if our IR Works. PM a link to it.

Sorry for asking, but our code did work...and now, it doesn't. We've plugged them into the right PWMs and the IR Beacons do work...and we've even talk to Kevin...from Kevin.org. It's getting very annoying.




Hi Brian,

Last week, our IR receivers stopped working after we replaced a few cable connectors on the circuit board they were soldered to. We also had one stop working when we replaced the heatshrink we wrapped the receiver in.

We didn't feel we used excessive heat in either case, but when we scoped the signal pin of the IR receivers afterwards, we found that they were no longer pulling all the way down to 0V, but were floating around 2-3V instead.

I'm jealous  :)
This is a good reason to get rid of the "ship after 6 weeks" rule.  Teams that build two robots (to work while their robot has been shipped) are already working through the entire competition.  The six week deadline isn't saving these teams any work or any stress.  In fact, if we didn't have to ship the robots, these teams would be doing less work (since building a second copy of the robot is obviously more work than only building one copy and keeping it).

It seems to me that the only teams that build two robots are the teams that have the money and/or manpower to do it.  If FIRST is interested in a level playing field (for the small teams), then perhaps it's time to do away with shipping the robot off in 6 weeks.  That way, everyone has a robot to work with between competitions.

I also think that this takes away some of the advantage to going to many regionals.  At the regionals, the teams get to work on their robots, work on programming, make modifications, fix problems, etc.  The more regionals you go to, the more opportunity you have to fix things.  If teams keep their robot, every team has equal opportunity to fix the robots, make modifications, etc.

Some may argue that this takes away from the "real engineering experience" of having a deadline.  I disagree.  You would still have a very real deadline: your first competition.  If you don't like having to work on the robot at the end of six weeks, then don't - no one would be forcing you to.


Are you using basicly the default code? Or did you rewrite the Default_Routine? Check below the pwm assignments, and comment out the stuff with pwm04. I had the same problem, and that fixed it. I think its limit switches, but I can't remember.




Truth, when I did that, it worked.  That was the only time it worked.  After that, it went back to behaving as before, but I'll be sure to double check it.  It's possible that someone changed the code without my knowing.  Other than the limit switch default stuff, pwm04 isn't used anywhere else.  Just out of curiosity, should the limit switch stuff matter?  I browsed through it and haven't taken the time to pick it apart, but I thought the default was set so that a certain set of pwms didn't operate is a digital input was set to 1.  Thank you both for your input.

We are planning to use laser printers that we have available to us at our school. And we also made a card last year but this year we plan to spread this around and hopefully teams will participate!

Right now we have our pump hooked up to one of the spikes on #5 and while it works (press a button and it goes on) it doesn't stay on and it's really annoying to have to hold it down.

I think* (i don't know how to code and no one on the team does) that all I have to do is something like this


when joystick button is depressed set a variable equal to one

then do an if statement, if variable equals 1 to set the relay to fwd, else if, set relay to neutral position i guess fwd and rev are equal to zero?

I don't know the proper syntax or way about doing this, but i think it would only be a 1 or 2 lines of code

could anyone tell me how to do it or write it out so I could just copy and paste it into our code? plzzzz

It's #5 if you want to write it out




This isn't what you're looking for, but you may like this, use it, and even learn from it.  In the default code, if you hook up the compressor to relay 8, and hook up your preassure switch( that came with your kit ) to digital in 18, whenever the preasure is below 95, it will pump untill it gets to 115 (or somewhere around there).  What happens is this:

relay8rev = !digitalinput18;

those names area ll wrong because I dont have code with me, but what it does is set the relay to the opposite value of the digital input sensor (in this case, the preasure switch).  If the swith is 1 (it's up to preasure) the relay is off.  If it's below presure (0), then the relay will fire up (to 1).  Hope you can learn something from this.

This may be related, so I'm posting it here.  Using the FRC-INTERRUPTS code posted by Kevin, our drive motors (PWM 13 & 15) went crazy (jerking back & forth)  whenever we tried to enable a timer interrupt.  The interrupt handler only increments a unsigned long.

Today, I'm going to start with a fresh copy of his code and only modify the timer initialization code to pin down the exact problem.  If the problem persists, I will post the mods for discussion.

BTW, our two Grayhill 61K128 encoders work fine at ~200 RPM using interrupts (INT1/INT2).  But disabling them, doesn't solve the problem.

What I'd like is a timer with a resolution of 0.1 ms or better.  My thinking is to have a timer interrupt update a counter every millisecond, then reload the timer register will a value that will roll over again in 1ms.  The timer register could be read to calculate the fractional part of the timestamp when needed.

FYI: For safety, we either put our robot on blocks or unplug the PWM cables from the drive motors when powering up the robot in close quarters.
Dr. Bot,

The recently posted field drawings ("2004 Field Elements") are representative of the actual fields that were built for the competition season.

You will see that the mobile goal drawing contains no reference either to 1" PVC or to a stiffener.

:)

Aidan
Bah.  Real men (and women) do it by hand :D
ITS.....ITS... ITS dah CRAW!!!!!!!!!  :yikes:  LOL anyway excellent photography angle. Looks good cant wait to see the actual robot


This is sort of what I was getting at.  As a teacher/coach/mentor, working an additional 30 hours a week during "build season" is something that I plan for and my wife is able to cope with.  The problem comes in when "ship-date" is not the end of the intensive building season - it is just the beginning of the intensive driving/autonomous programming season.

How do other mentors/coaches feel about this?

-Mr. Van





I work with my team 11 months a year.  So the additional time is not that big of a deal.  Also, I am not the primary "robot mentor". I have three other adults who head that up.  I am the teacher that runs everything else.  The key, I think, is to have other adults and students to help.

If you really want to be sneaky... find something on the team your wife may want to help with.  When she is addicted like you... that is when the real fun begins.

Team 60
Back in the shop, we've done some more testing.

Up on a table, with no load on the wheels, the breakers do not trip. Both gearboxes seem to be okay, and the few people here reassure me that everything is alined. We are using the spacers, we can turn it by hand, and nothing seems to be binding.

As soon as you grab a wheel and try and move, breakers start clicking. Another thing we're not entirely sure about is when the breakers trip, should the entire system go off? We get dimming of the relay LEDs while running with load, and Battery LED on the RC clicking to orange every few seconds.

I stress again that the wiring is not at fault, we're up to spec with FIRST's diagram.

Putting the robot on the ground fares no better. Driving in a straight line on a smooth shop floor is a fatal task for the robot. After straining to travel 5ft at a ridiculously slow speed, it totally stops and just clicks.

They just came in and told me that loosening things up made it a little better, but I'm going to go see if that's really true.
No, it isn't required, only optional if you want more control over your pressure.  We (548) are using ours, and are looking to collect a few spares.  If any of you that aren't using it would be willing to trade, let me know.
Thanks,
Josh

I agree that it's really taxing when the build season doesn't end with the six weeks. It's like "Well, robot is shipped. Let's keep working." But I think that it's part of the Gracious Professionalism thing; It all has to do with your mindset of what you're doing with your time.
If you think of it as: the coding or robot that you have at the end of the 6 weeks is your final product, barring some totally unexpected freakish bug, and you're using the post-build time as specifically testing the robot, I think it's ok.
It's like in the real world: The product that Ford or GM ships is the final version of the car for that year, but if there's a problem, then they can issue a recall and fix it, or a customer can bring it in under warranty. As long as you're just "tweaking" the existing model (program code) and not creating an entire new one or changing it drastically, I think it fits in with the spirit of FIRST.


Two of our so called "Robot Widows" ended up getting so fed up with the engineers not being home, that they decided to be part of the team too.
You guys just wish you had stuey now don't ya!

hehe... sorry stu...hehe

He may call them his babies...but I was the one who assembled them...because someone didn't get to robotics on time!!!!

*cough...stu...cough*
What gear ratios are you using?

Could you post a picture (or PM me one?)

This would help out a bunch.

Matt
Nice. I really like your claw.

Out of curiosity, is there a reason why the small balls look like they're riding on your robot? Thanks :)
WOW!!

Happy birthday, John!!!!  :yikes:
The details you get now are:
It makes full batteries empty.
It is a work in progress.
It has no name yet.
It is powerful.
It it fat.

The rest will come all in good time.
Elgin, questions that can be answered by archive.org are too easy ;)

Andy, Wasn't this supposed to go through the end of build season, so don't we get a few more days? If you need some more questions, I can probably help you out ;)
Well, gee, isn't *someone* well-liked? :)

Happy Birthday, John.  You should be taking the day off :)


The debate that was mentioned here last night, and for most of today, has been canceled. Keep an eye out for a place (moderated forum, possibly) to discuss this and other hot topics.

Thanks.




This should go without saying, but censorship is bad.  A special forum for such topics is okay.  A moderated one?  Not so much.
no, the motors should be going on 3 and 4 if using the navigate code:



// Which pwms are our tracker servoes and drive motors?  It
// is nice to only have to change this in one place.
#define left_servo pwm01
#define right_servo pwm02
#define left_drive pwm03
#define right_drive pwm04



Also being the electronics dude, I checked all of our wiring. Everything is straight to FIRST specification, and I've got the current sensors all built and ready to be read by the RC (that's another issue: figuring out what the ~500 value I get from the sensor really is, and what's the correct formula to convert it to amps). Neither motor draws more than the assigned voltage, as tested by a multimeter, but I don't think that really means much.






Hopefully I can help you out with the current sensors, at least.  Some other sucker on our team is responsible for the drive train ;)

I also read about 500 counts from the Get_Analog_Value(rc_ana_inXX) function call in the software, when the motors aren't moving.  When you think about this for a minute it makes sense.  Get_Analog_Value() returns an unsigned int (16 bits), but only the 10 least significant bits represent the voltage on the analog input.  The biggest number you can make with 10 bits is 1023.  We're reading about half of that, around 500.  The analog input on the robot controller can read voltages between 0 and 5 volts.  2.5 volts output from the current sensors corresponds to 0 amps (no current, motor stopped).  Maybe we're onto something!

Since we're digitizing the input voltage using 10 bits, we have to scale the number that comes out of Get_Analog_Value() appropriately:

input_voltage = Get_Analog_Value(rc_ana_inXX) * 5 / 1023;

The current sensors put out a voltage between 0 volts and 5 volts.  4 volts corresponds to 75 amps (fast forward), and 1 volt corresponds to -75 amps (fast backwards).  It's pretty linear in between.  Do a y = mx + b on this and rearrange to solve for current in terms of voltage.  Try it yourself, and you will find that drive_current = 50 * input_voltage - 125.  This will only give you an integer value for the current but at least it gets you started.  There are some tricks you can play with averaging and bit-shifting in order to get more resolution, but I'd concentrate on making the sucker drive first.

Hopefully this helps with the current sensing.  Let me know if you have any questions at all.

{edit}  There's a far easier way to do all of this.  In your message you mentioned converting the voltage reading to current, and I tried to answer along those lines.  But you don't have to convert to current in order to do simple current limiting.  All you have to do is figure out what voltage from the sensor corresponds to your threshold current where you want to limit the motor, and then figure out the corresponding number you'd get from Get_Analog_Value() for that voltage.  That's your threshold.  Note that there are actually two threshold voltages if you drive the motor backwards, because the current is negative if you drive backwards.  {edit}
It looks like it's swerve / crab.   Gearbox clearly incorporates drill and CIM motors (maybe more).  There's a pneumatic cylinder going into or through the visible gearbox - perhaps a shift-on-the-fly design.  The radio modem will be relocated before competition.

mmy motoors don't move
We added the transducer yesterday.  It was very easy, and I think it will give us much better control than the pressure switch.

I wasn't able to find any schematics for connecting it to the analog-in anywhere, but I guessed red-red, black-black, green-white and that seemed to work.

Hey guys i will check with wayne tonight but i think we can spare one battery.  It is one less you will have to worry about.

shaun team 25
v. nice. now is it standards compliant? ;) (heh, i had to find *something* complain about :) )

it really is a great site, though.
it might be helped if you also describe how you are turning it. if you have 2 joysticks for each of the sides for tank drive, are you moving one back on the y axis, while moving the other forward on the y axis?

our team had a similar problem a while back, and what helped was with the drivers, instead of full forward and full backwards on both sticks, alternate the sticks, going one forward, and the other backwards, it will be a slightly slower turn, but it might help.
well, you could always check out MSDN... chances are they'll have an article on it
The last 2 years we have done this our motors have gotten really hot.  They might not seem to be hot now, but try running them for 2 min nonstop at full speed.  Trust me, they will get hot.  Put the fans over the drillmotors.  The eletrical board doesnt need them cause nothing is putting out that much energy.
1018 is another Indy team that will make some waves this year.  These guys were runner-up in the BEST competition this past fall, so watch out for them!

Rumor has it that there is some special material in a part of these omni-wheels... or is it on a wheel that is not pictured.   hmmm.

Great job, 1018!

Andy B.


I can't remember exactly, but I thought the PWM cables that FIRST gave us had a chamfer on one of the corners and possibly a tab on the short side so that they can't be inserted in the wrong orientation.  Is my memory leaving me or am I right.  If the cable connectors do in fact have those features, does anyone have dimensions on them.  BTW, thanks for those specs.





yeah, they have something along those lines, but speaking as a stubborn person who has to deal with PWM cables in the pits, if you try hard enough, it can fit in, chamfer or no chamfer....
I just finished looking over the competition field drawings posted on the FIRST website. There is no mention of a stiffener.

While it might help, it would take some of the "challenge" out of shooting the balls.

shs, i already sent you a PM answering that question that you PMed me before you posted it here - check your PMs. but in the name of simplicity...

you need to add a call to Generate_Pwms() after the Putdata() line, like this:


void User_Autonomous_Code(void)
{
static long timeCounter = 0; //this will count the number of 26.2ms ticks that have passed

while (autonomous_mode)   /* DO NOT CHANGE! */
{
if (statusflag.NEW_SPI_DATA)      /* 26.2ms loop area */
{
Getdata(&rxdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will be stuck here forever! */

if(timeCounter <= 115) //3 seconds / 26.2ms = 114.5
{
pwm13 = pwm15 = 30;
}
else if(timeCounter <= 134) //we'll give the relays about .5 seconds to switch
{
pwm13 = pwm15 = 0;
relay1_fwd = relay2_fwd = 1;
}
else
{
//put stuff to do after the other things here
//you can also add more else-if statements to time other things
}

Putdata(&txdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will get no PWM outputs! */
Generate_Pwms(pwm13,pwm14,pwm15,pwm16);
timeCounter++; //add one to the tick count
}
}
}



Hose clamp

strap it on and screw it down





seconds the hose clamp. they work well, and arent heavy.
If by "special" you mean exotic, then you would be correct, the "spokes" are made of carbon fiber.

If by "special" you mean wierd, then you were correct.  We had k'nex wheels with o-rings in place of the lexan disks, but they kept slipping off when we were up against any force, so we had some lexan cut instead.
we should all take time to stop thinking of our robots raise our wrenches up high for a salute to John

sing with me

For he is a jolly good fellow, for he is a jolly good fellow.........

You know the rest


Poor John!  He is on the road interviewing on his 21st Birthday -- away from his friends.  :(

He has had quite an impact on this community, so lets all make sure we give his spirits a lift today!  (Kind of a virtual Birthday Party -- make him feel at home)

So... it would be awesome if we **all** took a few minutes to send him an e-Hallmark - or even just a short email wishing him a Happy!  You can find his email address on the 229 page here: [http://www.team229.org/about/roster/2](http://www.team229.org/about/roster/2)

Thanks!  No one should be away from home on thier 21st!!!

:)

Aidan, I think John is going to kill you :p



Anyways...Happy Bday to John!
One way is to get 1/4" or 34" bolts and bolt the pipes.  Make sure its really tight though.  You could bolt them in a "X" pattern.


Very clever and compact gearbox & swerve design.

Nicely done.

Joe J.

P.S. I have just watched the videos. Looks even better. One think I know from experience is that the control software and the operator interface are key parts of getting the most out of machines with the nerve to swerve. I know these were just baby pictures, but it seems to me that you have a lot of work to do in both areas.

This is not a criticism, but just a heads up while there is still time to improve -- we were one of the early adopters of swerve and I have spent 10 all nighters (at least) trying to get the robot to behave.

One consequence of not getting it right is that the drivers tend to get into the "blame the machine" mode where whenever the robot is not working, it is the software's fault -- sometimes this is actually the case, but a lot of the time it was operator error and the operator did not get better because they did not look to themselves as the source of the problem. Think about it.

Finally, please don't take this as a criticism. I like your design quite a lot. You have chosen a difficult path -- I solute you. JJ








Thanks Joe

That means alot coming from you. With the help of Ian and Karthik, 1114 has come along way from the rookie 7 stack builder it was last year. I look forward to seeing you in Atlanta. Watch out for the canadians this year. We've already seen 188's nice new 6 motor shifting system, and 781's beautiful cnc work  . Canadian regional should be very interesting

You can buy PVC adapters to get you to a pipe thread. ID and OD.
Then you can use a threaded rod ro connect with a solid connection.
Use PVC cement to put the plastic together.

Goaltending does not result in a penalty. The team whose goal is being goaltended would receive double the points of the ball that was blocked. The goaltending team's score is not affected.
Wu-hu now he can buy!!!!!!! Just not for minors nobody should do that and if you must drink and drive drink Pepsi! Anywho happy b-day John my best of wishes for you over your next 21 years and 21 robots! Tough luck being away on your birthday though


Lemme elaborate James,

We have roughly 130 ft/lbs of torque per wheel, we move at a top speed of about 8 ft/sec. We have plenty of power, but we cannot get the power to the ground, we are doing burnouts and skidding on carpet. We are looking into other wheel options, we are looking at things like gokart slicks and solid urathane skyways.

Thoughts?

-Andy




My thoughts would be two front gokart slicks and then for the back have a wheel with lots of forwards traction but not much side to side traction so you can turn.  We used 4 gokart slicks last year.  See the picture.  We ended up putting caster on cyclinders to drop down when we wanted to turn a lot.  We were reseting breakers.  So these would be great for the front but find a better way for them to slide in back with out giving up the traction forwards.  Maybe fully inflating them would help some though.<br><br>![slicks.JPG|428x500](upload://z4bgFzerOOm366GB6xQ4I6qqoSq.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![slicks.JPG|428x500](upload://z4bgFzerOOm366GB6xQ4I6qqoSq.jpeg.jpeg)<br>

Alright,
Where are you located?  Are you close to Chicago?
Really nice arm.....I love to see robots manipulate the 2X Ball.  One question though, how strong is the hold on the ball, I've noticed that a lot of teams have gone for this type of simple grabber but I've always wondered how easy it would be to drop the ball if the robot jerked or bumped into other objects on the field.
Keep the great pictures coming,
-Aaron
no, we're outside of detroit
Sweet webstie, very slick.  Nice work.
Don't worry about this so much now.  You will have practice matches at regionals to find out how judges on this rule.  If a team is removing the 2x from your goal during a practice match, have your human player throw a ball at the 2x ball (!!!!NOT THE ROBOT!!!).  It the ref throws a goaltending flag, throw another.  If he dismisses it because of intent you've got your answer.
i have a few questions ...

what if some of your team members are in grade 13?  do they count as seniors even if they are in their fifth year of high school?

what if one of the team members graduated from high school on january 30th.  does she go in as grade 12 or university student .. because she isnt in university and shes not in school either ... but is still considered part of the team ...

does White refer to all students with white skin? or Canadian/American background ?? (would a Russian count as a White student .. or Other Ethnicity?)

Does Asian refer to Indians as well? or would Indians go under Other Ethnicity ??

thanks for the help ..

A Question:

Is the "DV - NTSC" the same as the "DV/DVCPRO - NTSC" codec?

Note:

Happy Birthday John!  Remember John...there is nothing fun about being 21....nothing...::snicker::  Have fun!
Call the paremedics and take my friend AND the dream girl.  My freind drives and dream girl sits on my lap! You said she was willing to do whatever I want...
if i'm understanding you correctly, all you would need to do is duplicate the output of the left-side motor for the second motor on that side, and the same for the right-side second motor - where the code sets the right-side motor to a certain value, just set both motors on the right side to that value (and by motor, I mean PWM)
Troubleshooting this problem will be much easier if you can get you hands on a clamp- on ammeter. Check with your sponsors and mentors or find a local electrician that could help in finding one.

Put the robot on the bench with the wheel suspended.  Use the ammeter to monitor the current of each drive motor.  The meter should be placed between the circuit breaker and the speed controller.

Compare both sides running at the same speeds.  The current should be close for both sides.  There is a slight difference between forward and reverse for the drill motors.

If the current is high (&gt; 10-15 amps) then you may have too much friction in the drive system.  If the current is low on both sides, place the robot on the ground and monitor the current for each side while the robot is running straight.  IF the robot is drawing much higher current when on the ground vs. the bench, look for things that might add friction when weight is added to the wheels (i.e. wheel axles).

One of these two steeps will tell you where the potential problem is located.

Tim Tedrow
have you tried the code on www.kevin.org/frc yet?
What are you using for the non drive wheels?
That might work, but the back motors are different from the front motors, the front motors are CIM motors and the back motors are drill motors, does that make a difference?


Goaltending does not result in a penalty. The team whose goal is being goaltended would receive double the points of the ball that was blocked. The goaltending team's score is not affected.




Not saying that my team woudl do this as it is not GP but does that me that if we are holding the large ball over our own goal and our alliance partner goes to shoot at the goal and the ball is deflected on its downward path that our alliance would get double the point of that ball which was deflected? Or vice versa if the opposing allaince did this thing would they then get double the points?   :ahh:


I was just wondering... What kind of paint did you use? and how did you do it?




It's powder coated (Like a dust you melt on). I don't know much more than that about the colours.
I need to check our supply but we will be able to help.  We will most likely not be in need of batteries at the same time as you so we may be able to supply you for your matches, both teams.  This may not equal 4 batteries but swapping charged for uncharged after matches may help.  At least until finals.

I will get back to you tomorrow.
are you using a gearbox so that the motors end up matching spin speeds? if so, it should work fine. if not, you might need to make a function to translate the value going to one set of motors into an appropriate value for the others... i.e. if your chips are on pwms 1 and 2, and the drills on 3 and 4:



pwm01 = leftvalue;
pwm02 = rightvalue;
pwm03 = drillTranslate(leftvalue);
pwm04 = drillTranslate(rightvalue);



the drillTranslate() function might just be a simple curve, or you might need to use a lookup table.
Yes it does matter, especially if you are using the drill motors.  If because of gearing or programming you are back driving the drill motors you may do damage to the transmission.  You will need to adjust the speed so they run close to the same.

happy birthday john! i'll give you a 6-pack of pepsi at nationals if you come up to our pit and ask for a belated bday present.


v. nice. now is it standards compliant? ;) (heh, i had to find *something* complain about :) )

it really is a great site, though.




Well we do usually try to stay within standards. I can't say that I am 100% but my team has been warned about it.

I have tested it on different browsers and different os. My dynamic DHTML menu was the thing that gave us most problems. It was a bit complicated to align the menu properly at first (on Opera and Safari for Mac I noticed things would change dramatically so I fixed that up asap).
I have run Anim8or v0.85 in WINE on Knoppix. (I did get some errors but it did run!)(Now I just have to figure out a way to save settings and I won't have to use Windows for AN8 (That Dosn't count the whole NTFS problem.))

I have tried to run max in WINE, but I can't setup the DLLs right.
I won't go so far as to say what our problem was, but I'll warn other teams to CHECK THE BATTERY POWER before you take out the gearbox!

(We'll check around for an ampmeter, but a fresh battery seems to have fixed the problem for now!)

Thanks for all of your help.


What is the highest Videolengeth:Rendertime:Videosize that a team has had this year?

Ours is about 8Sec:70Hr(Approx.):720x480.  :ahh:

(I hope you can understand what I am saying. (I havent had a decent sleep since kickoff.))




I'd guess ours is 3sec - 10hr - 720x480 - about 10min/frame, which isn't too bad. You probably shouldn't be getting anything above 20min/frame since this is usually a sign of a poor scene management rather than computational complexity.

Here are 3 steps to bring your render times down:
1) split the scenes in parts. As a general rule, each camera shot gets its own max file.
2) Reduce poly count. delete everything not in sight, subsitute everything in the distance with primitive geometry, and apply multires to everything else.
3) Tune down your GI/raytracer settings. Its pretty hard to tell the difference in quality, but the rendertimes will be cut in half
Since the collaboration thread was closed Tuesday night, how then did a member of team 254 post the last word?  Stud Man Dan was the last person on before it was "closed".  I tried to post shortly after the Stud Man and it had been closed by then.  I got a daily notification just this morning that there had been another post to the thread.  It seems it is closed to some then but not to all?
just looking at your pictures i think i can tell why you are having your problems.  with the direct output of your gearbox going all the way to the wheel your axle is acting like a huge lever and missaligning your gear box.  while it may seem like your wheels might have a flex of only a milimeter it will affect your gearbox. what i might sugest is to separate that axle and conect it with a flex coupler to account for any mis-alignment that may occur. if you have a second set of the black plastic couplers that first gives you, you could cut your shaft attach the hex gear to either side and use the black coupler as your flex coupler...hope this helps feel free to PM me if you have any questions



btw have you made sure that the clutch is in the drill setting aswell...try this first

first of all, SCRIPT tags should go inside the HEAD tags.

second, the HEAD tag isn't closed - there's no /HEAD tag.

finally, somewhere you've got a CENTER tag that isn't closed - check the link above for more detailed info on that

if you really wanted to be standards-compliant, you could add ALT attributes for all of your images, but you don't *have* to.

So, to answer a couple of questions from the previous thread ...

We have two of these on our robot (rear wheels). They work MUCH better than expected (especially after the mod to replace the K'nex with Lexan). "Luci" is a four wheel drive machine with 9" pneumatic Skyways on the front. And obviously, from our low frame design, we won't be climbing the platform ... but we do have other surprises in store ... ;)

The large outer white rings are polypropylene. "Spokes" are carbon fiber disks, and we are using aluminum for the hub. MUCH THANKS goes out to our newest sponsor - WaterJet Cutting of Indiana - who made these wheels possible. All parts were cut using waterjet, then finished as required with milling, turning, and tapping. Our team had a great field trip to WCI to see some of these parts being cut and learn about the process. :cool:
Stu...I believe you are supposed to me working!

hehe...so am I!


Not saying that my team woudl do this as it is not GP but does that me that if we are holding the large ball over our own goal and our alliance partner goes to shoot at the goal and the ball is deflected on its downward path that our alliance would get double the point of that ball which was deflected? Or vice versa if the opposing allaince did this thing would they then get double the points?   :ahh:




First, you can't goaltend your own goal, so you wouldn't get double the points in the first scenario.

Second, if you are goaltending your opponent's goal, they would get double the points if the referee determines that you are intentionally goaltending (and he sees it). If you are blocking your own goal and they shoot at it, no one would get any points (you can't goaltend your own goal).
That post was in another thread, that got dismantled/removed.  I put the post on the end of that thread, to combine all discussion into one place.

As you may know by now, the Florida Regional does not have a social scheduled for it this year.

Well, we at team 1083 thought to do something about that.  We're looking into an "unofficial" social.  I stopped by a local bowling alley called Boardwalk Bowl today.  They claim to be the biggest bowling alley east of the Mississippi and south of New Jersey, and I can see why.  They have a HUGE facility.  From what I gather, they have 48 lanes available for us to reserve at 9pm on Thursday if we want them.  Of course, we could ge there sooner and hang out, but the lanes themselves wouldn't be ready 'til 9.  One game with 5 people per lane should take about 45 min.  After hanging out for a while, people should be able to get back to their hotels in plenty of time for their curfews.

Some key notes, it would cost each person $4.50 for one game and shoes.  This place has a Pizza Hut, concession stands, and a deli with Boar's Head meat.  They have a very large arcade with 3 air hockey tables.  They have 17 pool tables.  They even have a sports bar in there for the 21+ crowd.  And I heard that their wings are amazing.

To qualify for that group rate, we would need at least 15 people who want to bowl. (Heck, SPAM would more than account for that alone ;-)

What I need from you is some official word from your team whether you would be interested and how many would want to BOWL.  People who don't want to bowl can still come and hang out, but we need an accurate count of bowlers to reserve the right number of lanes.

RSVP by emailing to [email]pelln@ocps.k12.fl.us[/email] and we'll get back to you with directions and such.

So?  Does this idea sound like a winner?
Sweet


Nice. I really like your claw.

Out of curiosity, is there a reason why the small balls look like they're riding on your robot? Thanks :)




Thanks. The balls were put there because we were discussing protection for the inside of the bot (we're worried about something flying in there and causing some damage) so .. some protection is being designed now.  :)

As for the ball dropping, yes, it is easy to drop it, but if you get a tight grip and have good drivers, it should be fine. Its just one of those things that require some learning.
Hey Stu, knowing you this is your goal grab system that requires four of these used together with a 4 lb cylinder. :D  :D

Ok,
I can't run over there this afternoon, but you have a lot of teams close by that could give you some help if they were to see this in action.  You have removed the locking pawl from the drill transmission, haven't you?
My advice again is remove the drill motor and transmission and the driving shaft.  The remaining shaft with wheel on should turn freely.  If that is OK then, put the robot on the floor and try to push it. It should just keep going by itself, in a straight line.  If it doesn't keep going but goes straight then the bearing on the wheel shafts are not in alignment.  If it rolls, but not straight then you do not have the wheels parallel.
If all of that works OK then put the driving shaft back in and check everything again.  Remember that the driving shaft and driven shaft must be perpindicular else there is side friction on the gear faces.  Check that the gears are in correct mesh alignment.  This is a hard one.  Visualize a line perpindicular to each shaft (as if drawn on the face of the gear.)  Those lines should meet perfectly. If the tangent of the driven gear is not aligned with the center line of the driving gear, additional friction is built up.  If all of that is OK, you should be able to set the wheel in motion by turning the hex coupler on the driving shaft and the wheel should continue to turn by itself for a few seconds.  It make take a little trial and error to get everything to the point where it can make this test.  When it is all moving freely, put it back on the floor and test again.  There should be a significant improvement.  Once that is OK, put the drill and transmission back in and try powering the motors again off the floor.  Again the drive should free wheel after you remove the driving power if you have the speed controller set to "coast".  If all of this is OK then put the robot back on the floor and try to drive.  If everything was OK up until now and the breakers still trip, you may have to add a bearing to the wheel shaft.  The weight of the robot may be putting too great a load on the bearing you are using.  Let me know what you find.  I will check in again in an hour.

You could always make an autonoumous dongle.  Then you could go into autonomous at the flip of a switch instead of setting the team # to zero all the time.  [Directions from Innovation First on how to build one are here](http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/Competition_Port_Pinout_Guide.PDF)   Also the disable switch is a very useful safetey feature
We find that using a drill to cut weight is not easy--it takes houndreds of holes in sheet to make a difference-unless it's small to begin with, you use a holesaw, or it's thick stuff (but then the whole thing is too heavy anyway). We used a saber saw to cut large triangles out of the drive plates- saving about a pound per plate. Our wings are similarly cut.  We are now in the 120-125 range, so we are glad we did.

Many of you may have seen "wrench man", 449's logo. We have "person" made out of ~1" head wrenches, that weighs about 5 lbs. We hope to be able to add him to our robot (but only if we dont add any other weight for systems).

Hi all, here are today's 3 Questions...

1. What are 3 awards that were in exsistance in 1998 that are no longer around?

2. What orange flavored soft drink is made by the same company who manufactured FIRST water?

3. What and when was the first scholarship award created in FIRST?




1.) Featherweight in the finals, Best offensive, Best Defensive

2.) Fanta (Orange)

3.) 1996
OUCH !  :eek:   I should have known to exclude 234 from this quiz ... :D
We are still under the weight limit currently but we are resorting to "speed holing" our robot rather than swiss cheesing it in order to add another mechanism.  No important structural components will be drilled only pieces that are easily replaceable and do not harm the structural integrity of the robot or the drive train.  I like speed holes........doesnt slow the robot down so much..lol
1. Most Photogenic (Replaced by the imagery award), Best Play of the Competition, Featherweigh in the Finals, Outstanding Defense, Best Offensive Round

2. Faygo and Shasta are both made by the National Beverage Corp. and both have orange flavored drinks.

Too bad the k'nex didnt work out from the first set........It made my day to see K'nex used on a first robot.......lol.  Keep up the good work, those wheels are awesome :)


Some may say it makes the feel like a criminal when they havn't stolen anything.  Address to the students that "stolen items must be replaced with team funds.  Therefore, it costs you more when someone steals from the team."  I think that will make students prefer innocent searches over having to pay more or fundraise more to replace stolen goods.




I do not think that saying the replacements will come out of team funds will work because if a person is stealing from the team in the first place, i dont think they really care what effect there is on the team.  that being said, i do not have a better solution.

I like talking to the parents directly, but that is a problem when it is one of the teachers/mentors.

sorry that this is happening to your team and i hope that it all works out in the future

Well the drill motors have gearboxes but the CIM motors are not the same nor can we set them to the same speed, so how would I go about setting different values for the drill motors or vice-versa?

Just hook the black (gnd) wire to one screw and the white (signal) wire to the other.  You should crimp ring connectors on the end of the wires for a good connection.  The red (+5v) wire is unused.

In the future you should post a Technical question like this in one of the Technical Disscusion forums (Electrical or pnuematics).

[EDIT] If you are using the default program you need to connect the 3 pin connector to digital in #18 on the Robot Controller [/EDIT]
That's not really true, it more or less depends on the textures in your scene. If you have many materials with reflection and/or a lot of procedural materials (Like the ones I made) your rendertime will be high because of the reflections and having to shift through 18 different levels of bump maps.

Five seconds, 27 hours, about 9-11 minutes a frame was our highest.

Yes, reading from right to left does make things interesting. I did pick up a manga book once and I had previously thought myself good a reading comic books even though I don't read them much. But when I found out that they did it japanese style (right to left) I was often confused. :yikes: Oh well.




Originally I was too. I read a DBZ manga a few years ago from left to right and when I got about a fourth of the way through I noticed I was going backwards.

Those look very similar to the 2003 Cornell Robocup omni-wheels. Get any ideas from them? :)
Assumptions:
Battery is fully charged
(high current testing requires constant attention to charging)
(battery depletes fast with two 40A breakers cycling;
good 40A breakers open @ ~50A ea x 2 = 100A,
and open at lower currents as cycled more frequently)

BTW: **18AH SLA battery is discharged in 3 minutes at 54A to 8V !!!**
see the mfr discharge curves to verify, docs: 18ahExide.pdf

so at 100A continuous expect only a couple minutes at full energy.....

DO measure the current where the breakers open, (on full batt charge)
last year we found many 40A rated opened at 30A (~26A rating)

How ??
**Use a DVM, 200mV scale connected across the 120A main breaker**.

when ckt bkr closed the current is ~1A for each mV on the DMM !!!

A 3 digit DMM will thus read +- 199.9A

(The open ckt bkr reads ~12.6v, which will not harm a DMM)

First impression from photo's:

with 12" wheels you are geared too high

(are other wheels unrestricted castors ?
if so it should do circles rather well,
but may be hard to drive straight line)

use smaller wheels  3" would move well :)
or Gear Down 3:1, 4:1
I know neither is attractive at this point, sorry....

Uhh, Dave, the menu doesn't work at all when reloaded in a new page in Mozilla/Netscape. Just to let you know. You have the award for the CR.
I would count them as seniors.

The Russian depends on what their ethnicity, this could vary.

Most Indian/Pakistani consider themselves Asian, but why don't you ask to be on the safe side.



if dig in 1 is on then it should turn left
if dig in 2 is on both motors should dturn equally
if dig in 3 is on then it should turn right

PWM01= left side drive
PWM02= right side drive





i think what you are trying to do is



if (rc_dig_in01 == 1) ||  (rc_dig_in02 == 1) {
pwm01= 200;
}
else {
pwm01= 127;
}
if (rc_dig_in02 == 1) ||  (rc_dig_in03 == 1) {
pwm02= 200;
}
else {
pwm02= 127;
}



jerrw w
Yes, but only where no one could see them. like in the sprockets. only because our robot is going to be the best looking robot in the competition this year.
on a more personal note, i like to see holes in robots because they make them look more of an "unprofessionally" designed robot and you know that they did experience the weight issue that most every team deals with. :)
no we will be at suffolk which is a little closer to where we live?
Team 219 is bringing like 4 batteries, so if you guys come over to us, ill bet we could spare at least one (just bring your own charger!)
Our head programmer suggested:


if (rc_dig_in02) {
pwm01 = 200;
pwm02 = 200;
} else if (rc_dig_in01) {
pwm02 = 200;
pwm01 = 127;
} else if (rc_dig_in03) {
pwm02 = 127;
pwm01 = 200;
}else {
/* No line found.... */
}

Thank you both for your fast reply I will test both of those now and let you know when I get my results. THANK YOU SOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!! and best of luck to both of your teams.

Heres the code i ended up using:



if (rc_dig_in02) {
pwm01 = 200;
pwm02 = 200;
} else if (rc_dig_in01) {
pwm02 = 200;
pwm01 = 127;
} else if (rc_dig_in03) {
pwm02 = 127;
pwm01 = 200;
} else {
pwm01= 127;
pwm02= 127;
}



and it works perfectly thank you for your help
I'll give you a hint of what we were thinking...

[Starts with s, ends with onic](http://emulazione.multiplayer.it/sonic/SONICGUANTO.jpg)

hehe...
you could always order spares and have them sent to a team in nj and ask them to bring em for you
Not directly ... but I would love to see 'em.  Got any pictures ... or a link?
The other two buttons:
p1_sw_aux1
p1_sw_aux2

The joystick itself:
p1_y
p1_x

For the hat on top do a search. It is harder to use and has been discussed a bunch.


im bit confused about 26.2 ms loop area part

does that mean 1 = 26.2 ms when i set up a counter or something?  :confused:




It means that the code within that area is executed approx. every 26.2ms, so if you increment a variable it should indicate time in approx. 26.2ms steps.

Unfortunately, not everyone gets to go to the regionals after build season...
I think it is beacuse of the following:

The build season started in the first Saturday in January, which is right when people get back from Holiday vacation...

The season often ends near the final week in February, which is Winter Vacation for most people....

People often go away for vacation...

Therefore 6 weeks is essentially just out of nessesity so it dosent interfere with vacations, finals, AP exams and other things.


Our '2004 FRC Robot Controller' is having trouble running the default hex file (or any hex file). After downloading via IFI Loader v1.0.7, the 'Program State' LED stays blinking yellow. Shouldn't that LED turn green following download?
-clynch, 487


For the program to actually start running (and the LED to turn green) the OI must be turned on and in contact with the RC, either through the tether or the radio. My guess is you don't have the OI turned on/close enough. Hope that helps. :)

Lol! :)


Why isn't this working? I always get a value that's too high. 4 would give me the correct value, but 9 up always goes over. It's kind of weird too, every perfect square makes it go over a little less, you can check it out and see what I mean.





Do you really need a sqare root?  We originally had a square root in our waypoint calculation (to determine the distance from us to the waypoint), but we determined the square root was unessecary.  Why?  Because we're using feedback control to get to the position AND x^2 + y^2 becomes zero at the same point as sqrt(x^2 + y^2).  Anyway, it's just a thought - you may not need the square root afterall.

-Chris
Basically what he said, just simplified. To map two joysticks, you would do something like this:



// This code assumes the joystick are on ports 1 and 2 and pwm01 and 02 are the drive motors.
// These can be easily changed
pwm01 = p1_y;
pwm02 = p2_y;



That code just makes the Y axis of the joysticks on ports 1 and 2 run the left and right drive motors.


How funny that you post this right now :)  Earlier this afternoon I was teaching a team member how to tap when they broke off a 10-24 tap in a piece that took hours to machine.  If we can't find any other way to extract it, we will certainly try your tip!

Thanks a lot for such good advice Dave.

Cory




A long time ago, I used a different kind of extractor that was like a drill bit with left-handed flutes.  You put it in a tap handle.  At first, the extractor just drills into the tap.  Eventually, the flutes bite into the tap and the tap will start turning.  I haven't had to use one of these in a while so I don't know where to find them.
With 4-wheel, tank-drive, as you are using, your robot must be wider than it is long, or you will have trouble turning. Make sure your robot is 36" wide and 30" long, not 30" wide and 36" long. This will make a huge difference in the ability of your robot to turn.

If you cannot do this, then ensure that the lateral friction of your wheels is less than the longitudinal friction. That is, make sure that it is easier to push your wheels sideways on the carpet than it is to push them forward or backward. You may be able to do this by modifying the tread pattern on the tire, as mentioned in an earlier post.


Why isn't this working? I always get a value that's too high. 4 would give me the correct value, but 9 up always goes over. It's kind of weird too, every perfect square makes it go over a little less, you can check it out and see what I mean.



float sqrt(unsigned int tar, float accr)
{
float i;
for (i=0.0f;i<tar;i+=accr)
{
if (i*i >= tar)
return i;
}
}






Now, to answer your original question:

It is always high due to the >= that you have in the 'if' statement.  It won't return a value until it becomes equal or GREATER THAN your value.  The odds of it being equal are quite low.  Therefore, you're always going to get something that is higher.  In fact, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a value that is lower than the actual square root.

I see two ways to increase your accuracy (I could probably come up with more, but I just woke up).

The first is to make 'accr' smaller.  This will give you more accuracy.  However, this will also result in slower code.

Here is another way the should give you decent accuracy without much more computation:  linearly interpolate between the two points surrounding the square root.  Here is an example:




float sqrt(unsigned int tar, float accr)
{
float i;
float i_prev;
for (i=0.0f;i<tar;i+=accr)
{
if (i*i >= tar)
break;
i_prev = i;
}
// return a linearly interpolated value
return (tar*tar - i_prev*i_prev)/(i*i - i_prev*i_prev) *
(i - i_prev) + i_prev;
}




If you don't want to get that complicated, just average the two values surrounding your target:



float sqrt(unsigned int tar, float accr)
{
float i;
float i_prev;
for (i=0.0f;i<tar;i+=accr)
{
if (i*i >= tar)
break;
i_prev = i;
}
// return the average of the point before and the point after the sqrt
return (i + i_prev)/2;
}




But sometimes the tap may be too small for these to work.  If you break off a small tap in the bottom of a 3/4” hole, you can use an old machinists trick to remove it.  Steel taps will dissolve in a solution of alum and water.  If the part you are working on is aluminum or some other non-ferrous metal, you can dissolve out a broken tap.
-dave

p.s. Important Lesson learned: DO NOT use your spouse’s expensive aluminum Calphalon pans as the “heating vessel!”  The alum solution will very effectively remove the anodizing from the pans and leave bare aluminum.



Dave,
This is the first time I heard of the Alum trick.  Pretty cool.  On the second one, that is a pretty tough fix.  I wonder if Tom Edison had to put up with that?!?  You would think that restaurants would kind of spread the word so they could drum up some business.


That sounds about right.
We are also encouraging our kids to come up with their own designs (so long as they are tasteful and in the spirit of FIRST). Some day we'll have to make complete sets of all of our buttons to give away as a package.
We're also trying to make t-shirts to give away as well.




we do this too but then we normally end up with 60-80 designs but for some reason not this year.


Why isn't this working? I always get a value that's too high. 4 would give me the correct value, but 9 up always goes over. It's kind of weird too, every perfect square makes it go over a little less, you can check it out and see what I mean.

{

for (i=0.0f;i<tar;i+=accr)
{
if (i*i >= tar)
return i;
}
}






Why this goes over has already been answered, but I should also point out that this algorithm will be incredibly slow, and not particularly accurate.  Two things:

First off, it is a cardinal sin to have a floating point value as a loop index.  The problem is that floating point numbers always have some round off error.  And, each time you add, the round off error increases.  So, for example, if tar = 1, and accr = 0.1, after 10 iterations, you may get i = 0.9999999 or you may get i = 1.0000001.  If you get the former, you'll end up with the square of 1 = 1.1 b/c you'll go one step too far.  If you get the later, you'll get the right answer.  But there is no way to know which you'll get ahead of time.

The problem of floating point loop indexes can cause such subtle bugs that some languages do not allow it at all (e.g. recent versions of FORTRAN).  The following is the recommended replacement:



float sqrt(unsigned int tar, float accr)
{
int i;
float j;

j = 0;

for (i=0;j<tar;i++)
{
j = i * accr;
if (j*j >= tar)
return j;
}
return -1; //signal an error.  should never happen, but it is bad form to
//simply not return any value.
}



Secondly: the algorithm itself converges slowly.  E.g. if you try to take the square root of, say, 100 with accr = 0.1, it will take a LONG time (1000 iterations) to get a correct answer.  Try a different method.  The most common method to numerically compute square roots is called Newton's method.  Do a search on google for "Newton's method square root" and you should find some good example code.  Newton's method will converge to a reasonable value after only a few iterations.
The default code already has two joystick drive on pwm01 and pwm02. You just need to change pwms. No code changes necessary.


Also, shouldn't a breaker be tripping before wires start burning?  I mean, that's what breakers are for right?



Sandrag,
This is another of those little inconsistencies in electronics/electrics.  The modem is fed power from the RC which in turn is connected to a circuit breaker.  Normally the power supply in the RC will limit the voltage and current being fed to the modem.  The cable used to feed the modem may have wire as small as #30 which can only handle a fraction of an amp.  If the modem-RC has some form of failure and more than a fraction of an amp flows, that is sufficient to heat the wire but not trip the circuit breaker.  At some point the wires will begin to short together when the insulation has been comprimised and then the current gets high enough to trip the breaker.  Since these are auto resetting breakers, the condition continues until the operators get tired of the smell and smoke and turn off the power to the RC/robot.  There are also internal auto resetting breakers inside the RC.  They replace the fuses used in the previous version of the RC.  The current on the modem was fused for 0.5 amps in that version.
Sorry wasnt paying attention when i posted that it was off the backup file. heres the working version.




pwm01 = p1_y;
if (p1_y >= 120 && p1_y <= 133)
{pwm01 = 127;}
else if (p1_y < 120 && p1_y  > 133)
{pwm01 = (1/1635.6 * (p1_y * p1_y) - 0.16149181 * (p1_y * p1_y) + 9.10002);}

/******************/

pwm02 = p2_y;
if (p2_y >= 120 && p2_y <= 133)
{pwm02 = 127;}
else if (p2_y < 120 && p2_y  > 133)
{pwm02 = (1/1635.6 * (p2_y * p2_y) - 0.16149181 * (p2_y * p2_y) + 9.10002);}



Sometimes numbers are fun... not today.
Lots of holes tapped this year and no broken taps so far......but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  Nothing can beat some TAP Magic Aluminum and some patience.........(staying up till 1:40AM tapping the frame pieces one night).  Thanks for the tip Dave.

John:

Believe me, the teams in New Hampshire are most fortunate to have the support of you and the rest of the BAE SYSTEMS Team. By hosting a Regional right in the middle of FIRST Land, you help out not only those teams that received BAE grants, but also any team in the region that now can save thousands of dollars by not traveling to a regional several hours away.

Whether it be FIRST LEGO League, the Robotics Regional or individual team mentoring, the spirit of the support that you provide is very much appreciated by C.H.A.O.S.  Nashua was a Chairman's Award Recipient back in the early days of FIRST.  Thanks to you and your associates for keeping that spirit alive in New Hampshire.
My valentines day consisted of robotics stuff, then work until 930, then over to a friend's house who just got dumped where ice cream  and pulp fiction and house of a 1000 corpses.

I think my Valentine's Day was a good day for a single woman :D
I most sincerely apologise for the behaviour of Denman. 759 regard the chairman's award as really prestigious as it's the one which really embodies the spirit of FIRST. I'd also like to point out that we most certainly have NOT been building up a "portfolio" for this. We've been doing work in the community because we want to and we want to spread the word of FIRST and FLL throughout the UK. That, and we've really really enjoyed all the activities we've participated in this year
I'm quite hurt that a not very active member of the team (who isn't an operator btw either..) has come on here and posted that sort of thing, I hope everybody hasn't been given a bad impression of our team, we're all very nice really :)
When you submit the animation to Autodesk, you give them a license to use your animation for whatever they want, with or without credit to you. Thus, this can't fall into the educational clause. If Autodesk were to use it as part of their advertising, you would certainly violate freeplaymusics Terms of Use.
my only guess would be that maybe the engineer accidentally bumped the trim wheel when he was messing with the controls.  i wasn't there so that's all i can think of.  sporry about the injury to both of you though.
actually we got our name from spitting out random combinations of words until someone noticed that someone had come out with something that sounded good :)


ice cream and pulp fiction




Wow that does sound good :)
I think it's actually a giant Sparky 384 Wristband, and that's how you're going to hang from the bar  :]


Does anyone know if the code resets after being on for too long? Yesterday, we were working on code for our arm, and one of our engineers was messing with the joystick for the arm (he had it backwards when this happened). The robot suddenly just kicked on full foward until it came crashing into my shin, a full foot away ;), then it quit! We turned it off and when we turned it on again, our sponsor was leaning over it reactivating the kill switch so the bot could be on again, and it just kicked on again!!!! Our arm scratched our sponsor's neck and then went crashing into MY OTHER SHIN! Soooo now that you know the circumstances, why did it do that :confused: .


I don't think the code resets itself.  Maybe it was because the engineer hit the joystick, and you values were reversed also  (so full back on the joystick would go foward).  Sorry to hear about that though
drive? we just got our BIG aluminum skateboard done. with 12in pneumatic tires, and i heard its supposed to be electrically driven, but at this rate, not for a while...
I too would say that the engineer bumped the joystick, except we didn't have either joystick plugged into the first or second port. (we are running our bot of two joysticks) We had them plugged into port three and four because we havent gotton the two new ones we ordered yet.  We were watching our victors and no signal was going to the victors controlling the motors(the signals were going to the victors controling the arm ).
Maybe something screwy happened in the code maybe?
John,
I'm so glad you recieved this reward, I know me and a couple other BAE alumni were in the process of drafting up nominations for you. You help make FIRST better for all those involved. You kept Merrimack alive when there was no other place to get sponsorship from. You have kept all those NH teams alive with more sponsorships. You have been a friend, mentor, and hero to all those involved from Nashua and Merrimack. Thank you for always being there for me, FIRST would not be the same without you and neither would my life nor anyone else you have inspired. You have taught me to be a better person and you taught invaluable life skills, you give each and every kid a chance. Thanks was always in order for you, and now I'm so proud to see you recieve this honor. Keep teaching, inspiring, and being a friend to all those who cross your path, I will see you at the BAE Regional!!!

-Who else would dress in drag to raise one of their highschools money? :yikes:
I find most engineering work boring... I can't stand it!

I am planning on going into computer science type stuff; thouogh since most jobs went to india, it's hard to find a good paying job.

So in the end I'll try to work for the FBI, or any kind of armed service as a technology expert... I don't really know these days. I really don't want to work in general... I hate having a boss, I hate having to do stuff I don't really want to do...

That's why I enjoy FIRST, because I get to do something that I like, which is building stuff, as well as try out different 'jobs.' Some programming, some building, and some engineering.

guess that's my 2 cents,

cheers
The simple answer is to put the robot on blocks until you've debugged the control system.


A mentor on my team asked this question today and I couldn't answer them. Why do we only have six weeks to build the robot?




To quote Woodie at the 2001 Kickoff: "Because we wanted to have mercy"

He went on to explain that no matter how much time they gave us, we would always want or need more. So they limit it to what they feel is the bare minimum to meet the challenge at all.


Happy birthday Pam.




Thanks John, only a few more days for you :D

I've used Newton's system of finding square roots, and it is pretty fast. Take a look at this code, it only works for ints but it should be good enough for what you need. It takes a a number of interations equal to the square root. For instance, to get the sqr of 16 it would take 4 interations, 100 would be 10 and so on and so forth. See how you like it.

inline int sroot(int n)
{
int c = 0; int a = 1;
do {n -= a; a += 2; ++c;}
while (n &gt; 0);
return c;
}
Yes you have to compete in at least one regional event in order to attend nationals.


They won't approve a change so drastic. I suggest you make it the normal one off their website now.




They don't allow any modifications. I had a nice conversation with a Mr. Ken Freitas about this.

I don't think I can take more than 6 weeks working 16hour days.
8 for work and 8 for robot, 8 for sleep, and that's not counting drive time....  :yikes:
It may be the WDT or the Watchdog Timer.  It actually resets the pic microcontroller if WDT is not reset after a specific amount of time.  That is the only thing I could think of that can reset the PIC. Though I don't even know if that specific PIC contains it.

I will look into that and see if that is what happened. (My shins thank you very much.) I am not keen on having that thing come charging at me again!  :D

When you submit the animation to Autodesk, you give them a license to use your animation for whatever they want, with or without credit to you. Thus, this can't fall into the educational clause. If Autodesk were to use it as part of their advertising, you would certainly violate freeplaymusics Terms of Use.



why can´t it fall under the educational clause?
Can i use the music from freeplaymusic or not?
John,

This is a much deserved honor.  From the entire Team 103 family, congratulations.  You have always gone above and beyond for us as part of the BAE sponsored family.


why can´t it fall under the educational clause?





Since you grant Autodesk the right to use your animation for whatever they want, it is no longer non-commercial, even if it is educational.


Might I point out that 150/100 will evaluate to 1, not 1.5... there is no way to store a floating point number in an integer. You can hack around it by storing an exponent, but I don't believe setting myInt to 150/100 will store 1.5...


#define's don't evaluate expressions.
You don't evaluate (150/100). You evaluate (x * 150 / 100).
To get a floating point effect you do all your multiplication first, then all your division.

In integer math,e.g.,

x = 150/100 * 100 = 100
but
x = 100 * 150 / 100 = 150

Just be careful to type cast  the  expression to the largest size you need, e.g., using all *char* for the above will return an incorrect result.

Do you really need a sqare root?  We originally had a square root in our waypoint calculation (to determine the distance from us to the waypoint), but we determined the square root was unessecary.  Why?  Because we're using feedback control to get to the position AND x^2 + y^2 becomes zero at the same point as sqrt(x^2 + y^2).  Anyway, it's just a thought - you may not need the square root afterall.

-Chris




If you do find you need to compute sqrt(x^2+y^2), might I suggest the CORDIC algorithm (mentioned here before for sin/cos by Kevin Watson, I believe ... I found it very useful).  Here is a very good file explaining it: [http://www.andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf](http://www.andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf).  The nice thing about it, is that it is a "shift and add" algorithm ... which is very fast.  Maybe I'm just wierd, but I thought it was cool, and was disappointed when I realized we wouldn't be using it ... like Chris said he didn't need to compute the sqrt, we figured that we might not need to compute trig functions ourselves either.


I see a problem with them making the chairmans award regional, it makes it not as nearly as much prestigious as it was. We used to believe that winning the chairmans award would be much better than the actual competition, but if its now spread out accross however many regionals there are, it just doesn't make it as wanted as before.





*rhetorical* Not as wanted? IMO the point is wanting chairman like behavior spread out across many regionals, and that there are so many teams out there, winning regionally helps narrow the field at nationals.
You Constant (#define) can be a floating point value.
but....
when you apply it in your program  the result will be an int.
ie.

#define CONSTANT 1.5

int adjust_speed(int speed_in)
(
int speed_out;
speed_out = (speed_in/CONSTANT);
return speed_out;   //sends back an int
)

I most sincerely apologise for the behaviour of Denman.  I'd also like to point out that we most certainly have NOT been building up a "portfolio" for this. We've been doing work in the community because we want to and we want to spread the word of FIRST and FLL throughout the UK. That, and we've really really enjoyed all the activities we've participated in this year
I'm quite hurt that a not very active member of the team (who isn't an operator btw either..) has come on here and posted that sort of thing, I hope everybody hasn't been given a bad impression of our team, we're all very nice really :)




I hope you have been building a portfolio. I don't see anything wrong with that. The process of building documentation of all your team's doing with the intention of a chairman's award application helps focus on chairman like behavior.

All teams have less than active members who aren't operators, and who don't quite get the concept of the chairman's award. They are in process too.

I can't imagine a team with only less than active members who aren't operators, so I don't assume the whole team has the same opinion as one member.

Hope to see you at nationals. Intrigued and tickled to hear you guys are working hard at spreading the FIRST program in UK. We are always rooting for our international members, and dreaming of some day attending a regional overseas.


OK, so if Current.theta is an unsigned int, and I'm setting it equal to an unsigned long, what bits will I lose in the process? the most significant 8?
for example, what if I had this:



unsigned long longvar = 0xFAAABBBB;
unsigned int shortvar = 0;
shortvar = longvar;




shortvar would be 0xBBBB, right?

and a second question about that, am I getting an overflow error because the pic does math on an int level, and when an operation goes higher than an int I get an overflow error?

Thanks for all your help so far.


Yes, you'd get 0xBBBB.
Always use a type that will hold your largest possible final value.
In this case you could shift right 16 bits.

The PIC evaluates an expression based on the largest type variable used in the expression. You can add an explicit type, e.g., (long), to force the PIC to use a long for all calculations.

[edit] You can also force the C compiler to use at least (int) for all calculations rather than defaulting to the types of the variables used in the expression. In MPLAB under Project -&gt; Build Options... -&gt; MPLAB C18 tab add the compiler option -Oi+
1. Trace the code.
2. You need to ensure that the controls are being neutralized on start.
3. Are you jumping into auton mode? shorts, etc.

Before we switch the breaker on our bor, we tell everyone in a loud voice, Stand clear, Robot starting up.

Only one person near the robot during fire-up.
Only one person near joysticks/oi controls (to ensure no knocking of controls) Activate breaker in a  'safe' position.
(no ties hanging down, hand not in treads zone, not in front of bot, etc.)

Also make sure the robot is off before you stick your fingers in it.  Yeah you can imagine what happened.
i had the same problem. What you need to do is
1)hold down both the program and reset buttons.
2)Then, let go of the reset button. (The power light will be blinking green. )
3)Wait until the green light is solid.
4)Let go of the program button.

Now, the power light should be solid green and the prgm button should be solid orange. This is the time to download the code. Then after that, hit reset again.

PS.. that is probably one of 1000 ways to get it to download, but i seems to be the method i have most luck with.

Sometimes suqre numbers are fun... not today.


A warning about this code. You use floating points in the equations. The way C works, temporary results in an equation are subject to the same limitations that the final result will be. (I.E. if you are going to ended storing the result in an unsigned char, then none of the stuff that occurs in the equation should pass 0 or 255 either, because it will wrap around.) So, your results will probably be fairly inaccurate.

Also, it may be right, but just in case, the equation is complex, make sure that it is being evaluated the way you think it is.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong. :)

--EDIT--
Well, not all compilers work this way. I don't konow about this compiler. :)


How about just using a gyro to keep a true bearing durng autonomous. Otherwise, I'm with John, HuDAVS is the way to go. You are just limiting your total drive train power with any other method.



We use three methods: a gyro, the IR, and shaft encoders to maintain heading, position, and orientation during autonomous, but that doesn't help teams that don't have them. The method I suggest is for teams without any of these. It's essential if you are using true dead-reckoning.

We don't use any of them during driving mode, although we do sometimes modify the power curve to give more range at the low-end.

There are lots of answers and you'll see as many software solutions as robot solutions to FIRSTs game. It's part of what makes it all so interesting.:cool:

We are also encouraging our kids to come up with their own designs (so long as they are tasteful and in the spirit of FIRST). Some day we'll have to make complete sets of all of our buttons to give away as a package.
[quote]

Aughhh, setting the bar higher. Your post sparked a conversation between my husband and I. He pointed out that you have that many buttons because of different designs. Which reminded me our graphics guy created something very cool last year (haven't asked if I can reveal it) that we have yet to make come to fruition - it has to do with buttons.

Then my husband pointed out that some years ago he was at a computer convention where Microsoft had numbers on all their buttons, and if you found a matching number, you won a prize, so people were wearing 20 Microsoft buttons, and trying to find the match. He said it was the greatest marketing thing.[/quote]



As long as you are up during judging.. If it can stay off the ground for a minute you are definitely in the clear.45 second is probably good. What I was wondering is would it be legal to be touching at the end of time and settle up to non-touching in the time before judging. With in a couple seconds after using something like a series of springs.




As I just stated, FIRST has said that judging will generally take place after the 10-second 'come to rest period.' If your robot is where it should be by that time, you have nothing to worry about. FIRST has never made a direct ruling as to something which is triggered by power-off (e.g. a solenoid venting), but since you are not controlling the robot after the time ends, there is no problem, and this accoring to the rules so far is 'coming to rest'. Here's a ruling that you may be interested in:



**Q:**Would a hanging robot be scored if, after being powered down, it periodicaly touches the ground, but would eventually settle in a position where it would not touch the ground?

**A:**"Eventually" is typically about 10 seconds.  If objects have not come to rest by then, the referees may disallow its score.

The default code already has two joystick drive on pwm01 and pwm02. You just need to change pwms. No code changes necessary.

Ed,

We seem to go through this issue every year. We appreciate the fact that your team has standards for scouting, but perhaps a little more guidance is needed for the students.

Definetly, make sure they start with the FIRST website. I've seen a few cases where people post here for information on a team with contact information on thier website.

Next, show them how to search for members of chiefdelphi. It's gotten more complicated with the upgrade to VB3, so maybe they need more guidance. As Brandon has been diligently pointing out, there are many cases where people are posting before searching for members.

Next, they should use google. Its amazing what type of press coverage or other stuff that can give you contact information.

Lastly, they should post here. If they can't find contact information for multiple teams, they should have all of them listed in the same thread. Also in that thread, they should detail what methods they used to find the team.

One other thing, whomever has access to TIMS on your team can get contact information for any team (or so I'm told). Perhaps you should make that information availible to your students after they show a certain amount of effort in finding that information on their own.


I most sincerely apologise for the behaviour of Denman. 759 regard the chairman's award as really prestigious as it's the one which really embodies the spirit of FIRST.

Sally, Please DO build the portfolio of your team.
Repeat: Please DO built the portfolio....... ( I agree with Redhead)
This is PERFECTLY correct and expected for all FIRST teams. It helps record all the activities your FIRST team have participated in and allow you to compiled the Chairman’s Award submission for this year and future years. With a portfolio and good records future team member will not understand the journey and progress your team have made.
Every year senior members leave and freshman join your team. Within three years a team will turnover, because of this reason, I emphasize good record keeping of ALL events team have participated in. I have met many teams that have no idea of their team history. One particular team I’m mentoring is planning to submit their first Chairman’s Award but have no idea what their team has achieved in the past. But they will do it because it is a first step.

You don’t have to apology for Denman, it’s his opinion and this is what's great about CD. I have spoken with your team for three years at NYC. I think you guys are one of the best when it comes to Gracious Professionalism and a good candidate for winning a Regional Chairman's Award.

See you all at the NYC Regional and good luck with the Chairman’s Award.
:)

I know it was in the first version posted, and its also in the current version (2-10-2004). I haven't used any intermediate versions, but I find it hard to beleive that Innovation FIRST would have dropped it.

Lines 211 and 212 (in Default_Routine)
pwm01 = p1_y;
pwm02 = p2_y;


All I want to do is submit my entry form. I know I am supposed to "post" it to the site. I have gone there, but can't figure out how to stick it in the correct folder once I have entered info into the forms.

I date back to the age of dinosaurs and, yes, I learned how to use a slide rule in high school.

I have a question where do we connect our motors in what Pwm for the code navigate.c can anyone please tell me and our robot is 2 wheel drive. and we are currently using pwm13 and pwm 15. :ahh: :confused: :(



Remember the navigate project doesn't come with a Default_Routine(), so you'll need to add one.
If you've added navigate to your default code then you need to change navigate.h  "left_drive" and "right_drive" to match the pwms you are using (pwm13/pwm15).


The default code already has two joystick drive on pwm01 and pwm02. You just need to change pwms. No code changes necessary.


I just thought the example without all the extra stuff would be helpful. :)
nice hanger but what is with the screwdriver in the middle
My guess is that it would ruin the shaft and eat it away as well.
I'll answer 1 and 3, becuase I am teamless and don't really know too much about my old team's autonomous mode...

1.) I've always believed that a good strategy is one that can be adapted to the situation. The great thing about this year is that there are so many good strategies that come out of the game that you just can't call the dominant strategy yet! What I've also learned is that what happens at one regional may not happen at the rest of them. So, small balls may dominate the first week, but the second week it may be all about the bar.

3.) I definitely feel that the game this year will come down to two people: the driver and the HP. And it will all be about finesse. Whether a more accomplished driver will be at a better advantage than someone who's never driven before may be generally so, but theres always that one or two rookie drivers with a ton of natural talent that will blow the competition out of the water ;)
i cant get this to work. I input all the values i want.. then click on export. It brings up vb code windows. It also gives me a error that says macros cannot be used in this project. I have tried everything i know about excel (very little) to get this to work. What should i do?
In one word?  Me.  I am not an engineer.  I have never been good at science and I never will be.  But being involved with FIRST has totally changed my outlook on life.  I am a member of our team's Chairman's Award group.  I love being a member of the HOT Team.  I am around all of the science and technology and FIRST has given me the opportunity to realize how appreciative I really should be of it all.  I understand that there are a lot of things that I can't do, and I have gained a whole new level of respect for those who can.

When I started on the team, GM engineers were just people who made cars.  Now I realize that all engineers are people who have what it takes to make an incredible difference in this world.  I watch at competitions as high school students create things that only a few years ago couldn't even be dreamed of.  I watch in astonishment.  The way I see it, that is what FIRST is about.  Even though I can't do engineering, I can express my pride and how I've been inspired by all of this in the way that I know how to do best, by writing, by documenting my pride in an incredible thing called FIRST.

But anyways, that's my personal opinion on why the Chairman's Award is a part of FIRST.

I'm hoping to turn in my forms tonight, but I was wondering a few things.

1. How should we fill these out? In a word document and upload it, or should I print it, fill it out, and scan it in?
2. Do we print, sign, and scan the consent sheet?
3. Does the team champion have to be an animator?
4. We have two people writing and playing music for us. They *do not* go in the list of people, right?

Wow, that beats my 8 AM to 12:30 AM.  I'm sure some 2:30 nights will come though!
In past years (2000) specifically it was ruled that the judgeing would start after everything has come to a stop... basically if your robot is heading for the floor they will wait to see where it stops... reason has to be applied to this too.. if you cannot easily see that the robot is moveing IE somthing like 1/4" per second or somthing then i wouldent worry as much.. but i think either way i would be a latch on your robot so that when you are up.. your not comming back down. This would eliminate all worries.
I am so happy to say that yesterday we did get our robot driving. Though I only got to play with it for a little because I had to go and our mentor was had to take the motors to modify the clutch so it doesn't. Hopefully after President's day we will finishing off the last of our subsystems and be done.

just one more more question (maybe more depending on the answer...lol).  im trying to write a practice autonomous code for the robot.  my plan is to use the 'p1_sw_trig' button to enable a set of actions (in this case just to move the motor forward, then stop, then backward, then stop again using the counter function.  im getting really weird syntax errors that i have no idea what's happening.




int counter = 0;

void Process_Data_From_Local_IO(void)
{

if (end_program != 1)
{
counter++;

if ((p1_sw_trig == 1) && (counter <= 120))
{
pwm01 = 127;
}
else if ((p1_sw_trig == 1) && (counter > 120))
{
pwm01 = 255;
}
else if ((p1_sw_trig == 1) && (counter > 240))
{
pwm01 = 127;
}
else if ((p1_sw_trig == 1) && (counter > 360))
{
pwm01 = 0;
}
else if ((p1_sw_trig == 1) && (counter > 480))
{
pwm01 = 127;
end_program = 1;
}
}


/********************************************************/

the arrow points to the line that the syntax error was shown at.  i put the code under the 'Process_Data_From_Local_IO' code because when i'd put it in the 'User_Autonomous_Code' it would give me an error at the 'Process_Data_From_Local_IO' line.  let me know if im doing something wrong (obviously i am...lol).  im pretty much a beginning programmer (HTML and TI-83...lol).  any help you can give will help greatly.

A mentor on my team asked this question today and I couldn't answer them. Why do we only have six weeks to build the robot? The first regional isn't until 3/4, but we have to ship on 2/24. Wouldn't it make more sense to give us more time in the future? I know that part of the challenge is the time limit, but wouldn't we be able to accomplish a lot more with more time? Especially rookies who have to learn everything as we go. I'm not criticizing, I'm just curious what FIRST's rationale is because I've never seen it explained.




Besides the alignment of the moon, sun, and Mars…
I believe the formula is quite complicated.  Like Ken mentioned, it has to do with the holidays, the college breaks, the football season, the baseball season, availability and cost of stadium facilities, college finals, spring break, volunteers, vacation period, seasonal travel cost etc. You name it!

When it comes to engineering, most experienced engineers will tell you, “more time means more opportunity for more complexity and more problems.” One of the goals of the FIRST competition is to put the students in a real life engineering situation- a project is given with a fixed due date. Customer requires a finished product and delivered on time or else this affects your company’s (the team) bottomline (ability to compete).

Rookies obviously have the hardest time with the short building period, that’s why there are awards specifically for rookies only. So don't depend on a robot to represent your team only, show the judges your efforts doing the whole building process and what you have learned from the experience.
(The journey is the reward- the FIRST regionals are just a celebration of your achievements)
All this has been documented in the past by FIRST. It’s just a matter of finding it.
yeah im using 2 different computers so i couldn't copy and paste it.  i just typed it up at warp speed because i need to get this figured out before 4 today.  there aren't any mistyped statements in the real code.  and as for the answer you gave me for the first problem...thanks but i didn't need it anymore.

Makes sense.  We will just do a brake or something to prevent it from sliding . .  it barely does as is . . . and it doesn't when the power is off, so maybe we will just look at the jumper on the victor and switch it to stop the slide.

I guess testing is in order, but its not a huge problem.

No I'm just kidding. To answer your question, yes and no. I've seen his little 'curvelicious' demo online, but I created the curve completely independant of it. If you look at the source, it's developed differently. I used my own technique of two-colour transparent PNGs to get the effect to work in both site themes with a textured background. In my opinion, my way is better than his :) . I was thinking of dropping him a line about it actually. I know he has a style-switcher on his website, but his is all javascript, a no-no in my mind.

what you can do is hook up one side of solenoids Positive wire to the relay FWD output. Hook up the negative wire to ground. Do the same with the other side of the solenoid, just to the relay REV output. Then in your program you will be able to open and close your air pistons by setting buttons to relayx_fwd and relayx_rev.


What is the natural state of digital input pins on the RC. My mind tells me low, some documentation says high, and some other CD users say low.


Each digital I/O has a light pull-up to Vcc. So without anything driving the pin, you'll read a logic 1. It's documented [here](http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/Analog_Digital_IO_FRC_2004.pdf).

does anyone else have any suggestions for a solution?  like i said, i MUST get this down by 4 today.  i've spent all yesterday (6+ hours) and now today (another 6+ hours) on this thing.  our robot will be up and running very soon and i want to try to tweak the autonomous as much as possible and as of now, i can't even figure out how to create an autonomous mode.   :(
...nervous since he wasn't a robot.  I decided to...

Looks like the most likely reasons (assuming of course that it is actually a reset, which it might not be) would be the stack over/underflow resets.  Are you doing anything funny in assembly?
team 195 has about 5-6 people who show up every day for the entirety of the meeting. Then we have about 20 other kids who show up when they want, dont get anything done, and get in the way.

now for your question, i think both situations have pros and cons.
**Large Team Pros: ** More money will come into the team; more support; your team takes up more room at competions; more people to place blame on when things go wrong; more can get done when organized properly.
**Large Team Cons:** More time taken to organize things than actual work time; people get in  the way; people complain when there is nothing to do, even though they wont do anything they are givent o do; more space needed to work in; some people only show up some times, and expected to be filled in when they choose to show up; can turn into a disaster when not properly organized; team members find themselves with nothing to do.
**
Small Team Pros:** More can get done by individuals. More communication between team members; jobs can be distriuted easily; everyone is always busy with something; the same people always show up; no one to annoy you as you are trying to work on a project
**Small Team Cons:** Less money is fundraised; Nowhere to run when you mess something up; Team may looked upon as amatuer at comps compared to huge teams with 30+ people; a meeting missing a person may be a waste of a meeting

Thats my 2 cents
We have 15 or so students, but only 6 show up regularly...
[LAHSRobotics.org](http://www.lahsrobotics.org)
A laptop for programming (the portable defibrillator)?  ;)
If you don't trust their answers, just take a multimeter to it...  is it 5v or 0?
We have about 14 students and about 10-12 are at any given meeting.


Hello,


Team 610 has hooked up their IR sensors, and they detect the pulses for 360 degrees. We took a 4 inch steel rod (3/4" thick) with a 1/2" hole threw it. We put the sensor threw the hole, and it still detects pulses for over 180 degrees.

Can anyone suggest what to do? (we tried other things before the steel rod)

We're stumpped.


Thanks in advance,


Team 610




Try using a non-reflective substace for your 'binders'

I think whats happening is that any pulse that can get into your steel tube just bounces off the walls until it reaches your sensor.  Use black non-reflective plastic or something.

I've heard that heatshrink (wire wrap) works very well, also.
I've been on both.  This year I'm leader of a small team, and I really like it.  There are six of us on a regular basis, plus a few floaters.  From the adult point of view, small teams sure make paperwork easier.  I also like how we operate.  Last year i was a student on a large team  (About 50 students), but because we were diveded into subgroups (Build, Management, Chairmans, Digital, Spirit, and one other I forgot), it didn't usually feel like such a large team.  I was on build, and was pretty good freinds with the others on build, so it almost felt like a small team.   This year on that team is a young year.  About six seniors graduated last year, so there's a lot of freshman/sophmores.  I think they'll be a better team in a few years when they all learn to work with one another.

This is back to that "does your team operate like a family or a business" question.

On 1313, we operate like a family, disfunctional at times.
On 226, the team as a whole operates like a business, but the build group more of a family, or possibly family business or a disfunctional family business (usually late at night)

On 1313, I'd really like to increase the team size.  My goal is 15 for next year.  But I think 226 is too big this year, or at least the build group is too big.  There's not enough for everyone to do.

If you really, really want to use a potentiometer, why not use the Bourns [6639S-1-103](http://www.bourns.com/2/pdfs/6539.pdf) which is available at [Digi-Key](http://www.digikey.com) (search for 6639S-1-103-ND). I'd rather use an [encoder.](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23192)

-Kevin


I am in heavy deliberation at the moment. I am trying to decide whether or not I wish to use a potentiometer or encoder for something relating to the subject of this thread. I am pretty much at a loss for good reasons (I have never used potentiometers or encoders before), so I am wondering why you have a bias that steers more towards an encoder than to a potentiometer.
i would have done that, but im at home right now, writing the program.
any parts that you afraid are  gonna break extra shaft, chain, motors, stock, screws, wheels,pneumatics

We carry almost 2 of everything we need and we preasebmle some stuff
a hammer to 'realign' everythig that gets bent.
you may not use two compressors i know its in the rules somewhere i just dont have time to find it
yeah i would send it back to first but before you do that make sure your joystic centerpoint adusts are at neutral and that theres nothing wrong with the program.
you would use the 16 gauge wire, its the one in the grey sheath with 2 leads, a red and a black. its about the width of a pencil
we have maybe atotal of 10? idunno, never seen more than 4 at a given time. i'm the only one who's ALWAYS there. some are kept on the team for the reason they got some money for us. otherwise they wouldn't be on the team anymore.

having less people is easy to work with, but you can never get things done in time. we don't need any more people. we just need 20 hands working continuosly instead of about 6 hands.
hey count team 195 cyber knights in.. (i saw an earlier post about tailgating at nationals and thought it was a pretty cool idea)
im also pretty sure you can't use two cylinders.
also, there was a forum on using extra tubing as a  'kinda' air tank. it turned out that that wasn't allowed. but if you reaaally need more storagetanks, you could use extra cylinders (not tanks) as a tank. i think.
yeah our team did not recievec any ground stud, i took a piece of angle al and drilled a bunch of holes in it. the botom is electricly insulated from the chaises with a piece of lexan that was epoxyed to it (over the bolts). as long as you dont touch the frame, almost any handy piece of metal works great.

last year i had a fun experence with a home made ground bus, the bolts shorted to the frame and when the positive lead of the battry went floping around... big blue spark! dont do it
okay this is being made more confuzing then it is. you feed the sensors +12 and ground in the red and brown blue wires. you can then connect the signal wire you want (nc/no) to the RC digital inputs. they are already pulled up for you at 5v so you dont have to do any work. i would ground the sensor sepretly then from the pin on the RC, but it realy doesnt matter
good god! not an 'electric iron levitation module'!!!!

On a more serious note: I hope more teams do ball hoppers, because we didn't and it'd be great to be allied with a hopper team.

If hoppers are rare, you will prob get picked for the elims even if you don't finish all that well.


Remember the navigate project doesn't come with a Default_Routine(), so you'll need to add one.
If you've added navigate to your default code then you need to change navigate.h  "left_drive" and "right_drive" to match the pwms you are using (pwm13/pwm15).




what do you mean by the above quote i don't get it because we have a 2 wheel drive robot operated by one joysitck and we dowloaded navigate.c in our robot and it doesn't work the computer tells move to centre, turn to right.. don't know but it says something like that but our robot doesn't move although the programm is giving out command do you know why?  :ahh:   :confused:   :(

the way ive found works best requires 4 diods.you hook the postitves from each one up to inversly facing diodes to the o+ and the ground to the o-. this way you can never trigger both at the same time.
zip ties.


Zipties will fix just about everything.

As I recall navigate.c by default expects the motors to be attached to pwm03 and pwm04.
If you are using navigate without any modifications then it waits at the start for someone to push the forefinger button on the joystick before starting.
marbles are glass right??? and a 130lbs robot slamming into a diamond plate 6in wall at (i dunno how fast you guys are, but say) 6ft/sec. is that marble still intact?
and how did you get those marbles to stay in the hole? apoxy?


o, sorry about that. didnt know if there was a post about this or not. sorry again.






I'll reply anyway


Old, because the new joysticks are both right-handed.  Makes it hard for anyone but a mutant to drive a two-stick configuration comfortably.

Yes, they are glass.   And yes, perhaps they are breakable, but we have driven this thing on concrete at 8'/second with no breaks.

We realize it might be a problem, thats why we didn't glue them in (we haven't had ny fall out, either) so we can replace them easily.

we also drop the marbles alot, on concrete, with no problems.

Come to think of it, I've never ever seen a marble break.  A sphere is a pretty strong shape.

BUt we might break one or two during competition.  Thats what spares are for.
actaully it doesnt matter how much storage you have, if your compressor cant keep up with your air demand

I take it you are using the pneumatics to move an arm or something, and when you move it back and forth a lot the tanks run dry?

in that case you want the hose between the compressor and the tanks as short as possible, so it have the least amount of resistance (more airflow) and you want to regulate the pressure to the cylinders as low as possible for the task you are performing, to use the least amount of air - also you might consider using a cylinder with a smaller diameter, that wont use as much air as a large one (if you dont need all that force)

BTW - putting extra cylinders in your system WONT give you more capacity because they are past the regulators, you would have to put them on the high pressure side of the regulator to store air - and that is against the rules.

Putting extra cylinders in your system will keep your pressure from dropping as low as it would without  them, but it wont let you cycle your clinders any faster, because the only air coming into the system is through the compressor. If you 'need' 60 psi then you cant get it by using extra cylinders as storage.
oh they break alright. in middle school, i once tried to beltsand a marble into a shape of a cube. the sander did grind quite a bit of the marble away before the marble literally exploded. yes. it was pretty scary. thankfully no teachers were watching. no harm done, but i learned my lesson. still don't know exactly WHY it exploded, but it did.
that doesn't prove if marbles will break on impact but if i were the judges, i might say that it is a hazard in the field because IF it breaks, it can be sharp.
i'd check with FIRST if i were you.
i'm also looking for a way to help us turn easier. i'm not sure zip ties are the best way either. if anyone thinks up an idea, please contact us or post it somewhere.thanks!
I cant remember what the joysticks do when nothing is connected - logically it must default to 0 or 254? Im sure it defaults to something, but to depend on that with a live machine online is a little risky.

Whenever we powerup our bot on the cart, or on the floor while we are messing with it, we always chock the wheels

and pull the fuse on the compressor with the pressure release valve open.
KenWittlief, you're right. i was actually considering using more cylinders  as tanks. good thing i posted a mistake :D  thanks!
Don't worry, it's not only the newer teams that have a pretty small number of members, Team Hammond usually has only about 20-25 students (at  least since I've beeen on the team and I'm a senior) and this year we have only 18 members (with about 15 or so are at any given meeting). Having a small team does **not** mean you can't go far, just make sure everyone knows the game, and what your robot can do for competition.
That is not entirly true. Although the cylenders would only store 60 PSI, they would have increased volume on the system. More volume means that the pressure that exists when the active cylender is extended will be more. More volume will always help.
no - if you need 60 psi on your active cylinders, then the extra cylinders will only be holding 60 psi - so they cant source any air that wont have to be replaced by the compressor - so it will take LONGER for your regulated side to get back up to 60 psi

cause the compressor will have to fill the cylinder that you moved and the unused ones that are just sitting there. Without the extra cylinders the pressure would have dropped lower in a smaller volume of space, and the compressor would fill the space faster (due to the lower backpressure). With the extra cylinders in there, the pressure wont drop as low, so the compressor has to pump the same amount of air back in, but at a higher back pressure.

To use extra cylinders as storage you would have to use two regulators - putting the extra ones at 60psi, and using the active ones at something less, probabally 30psi for the extra ones to do any good.

and that will still only help you if you dont use the pnuematics for a while, then you use them alot for a minute, then you dont use them for a while again.
HOLY WOW THAT'S AWESOME.

... but what does it do...? lol


why can´t it fall under the educational clause?
Can i use the music from freeplaymusic or not?




I brought the Educational Use to the attention of Freeplay in the eMail he sent, and as you can see from the reply in the first post, it doesn't fall under that when you submit it to Autodesk.  I gave him links to the Copyright pdf, as well as the Visualization Rules, so they had a good background of the competition and if it falls under their terms of use.
are the diodes nesseccary if programed corectly?

ie turn off one before turning on the other.

sence the point of the diodes is to prevent them from going at the same time it would seem a good program could do the same....i dont feel like making another time waisting trip to radio shack.


Yes, you'd get 0xBBBB.
Always use a type that will hold your largest possible final value.
In this case you could shift right 16 bits.

The PIC evaluates an expression based on the largest type variable used in the expression. You can add an explicit type, e.g., (long), to force the PIC to use a long for all calculations.




Thanks! your suggestion worked.  Now the robot's printing out the right values.  Now to get the motors to turn...


i cant get this to work. I input all the values i want.. then click on export. It brings up vb code windows. It also gives me a error that says macros cannot be used in this project. I have tried everything i know about excel (very little) to get this to work. What should i do?





Excel has a security setting that disables all macros, and I think this is the problem.  Within Excel, go to Tools &gt; Macro &gt; Secuity and set the check box to 'Medium'.  Then close Excel and re-open it.  Now it should prompt you and you should select 'Enable Macros'.  That should do it.  If not let me know...
;)


I dont know if this is a joke or not, but titanium is not allowed. It is listed clearly on the exotic parts list.




I can't seem to find an exotic parts list in this year's rules. Perhaps you are thinking about last year's rules? ;)
now that I think of it, you are better off using a larger diameter cylinder at a lower working pressure than you are using a small diameter at a high pressure

because the compressor can pump more volume of air at the lower pressure - so that approach would let you cycle the cylinders more frequently.

if you are running larger cylinders at 30 PSI then the tanks can drop to 32 psi or so before your applied force starts to drop - and the compressor can get more volume at 30 than at 60

if you are running them at 60, then the compressor will start to fall behind at 62 psi,and will have a harder time keeping up with the demand.
i thought you are only aloud to use two storage tanks and then as many cylnders as you want

doesnt it say somewhere you can use only whay you are supplied wiht
ex
given two motors = only aloud two motors
2 storage tank =  aloud only two storage tank
etc


I cant remember what the joysticks do when nothing is connected - logically it must default to 0 or 254? Im sure it defaults to something, but to depend on that with a live machine online is a little risky.




They default to 127. It is covered in this thread: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24813
Yeah, thanks for checking that out for everyone, squide!  We'll make sure not to use it now.
right the OI output defaults to 127 when it detects infinite impedance on the joystick input

but infinite impedance on an input makes it very susceptable to noise or glitches.
ok i've gotten this to work.. but how exactly would i use this in my code?


oh they break alright. in middle school, i once tried to beltsand a marble into a shape of a cube. the sander did grind quite a bit of the marble away before the marble literally exploded. yes. it was pretty scary. thankfully no teachers were watching. no harm done, but i learned my lesson. still don't know exactly WHY it exploded, but it did.

ANother idea is to buy flooring epoxy (have you ever seen an epoxy floor -- I have one in my house, its good stuff) and cover the kit pneumatic wheels with it and let them harden.  Then you have (basically) wheels with epoxy treads, plenty slick enough for you.
this has been talked about over the last couple days - It might not be ok with FIRST for teams to build custom battery charges anymore:

http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25106&highlight=charger+box
I'm not sure if the IFI initialization routines disable it or not, but the watchdog timer would reset the microcontroller after a certain amount of time, which could cause problems like those you're describing. If you want to make sure that's not the problem, read the 18F8520's datasheet to figure out how to disable the WDT, and toss the necessary assembler code into your program.
Ive never heard of anyones controller doing something all by itself after running for a while - Im talking about running for hours, so I really doubt the PICs watchdog timer is doing something on its own.

One possiblity, if you have an error in your code that causes an infinite loop, or that takes too long to run, the OI link program will disable your outputs (thinking your code is lost in the woods) and that might cause a reset of the OI.

This is starting to sound like CS101 syndrome (my SW is ok, the mainframe is broken! )

most likely there is something in your code that is causing the drive motors to lurch.
The diodes are necessary for blocking if you wire the double solenoid valve in this configuration. There's a diagram in the manual that shows you how to do this; it's simple and inexpensive, and it's definitely worth the extra effort.

Incidentally, does anyone know if it's legal to connect a pair of single solenoid valves using this method?


I am in heavy deliberation at the moment. I am trying to decide whether or not I wish to use a potentiometer or encoder for something relating to the subject of this thread. I am pretty much at a loss for good reasons (I have never used potentiometers or encoders before), so I am wondering why you have a bias that steers more towards an encoder than to a potentiometer.




Because almost all potentiometers that will find will not revolve all the way around. Also pots wear out very easily when attached to a constantly rotating shaft. Last years controller was too slow for using an encoder. This years processor has no trouble keeping up with a 256 tick encoder. We have ours controlling our motors beautifully right now. Dead recoding is incredably precise with them. It's not a bias, it's just one is better than the other.

open up the OI pdf file. there is a list of pinouts.  the reason the button wont work is that not all the buttons are connected to a pin.  if you put the joystick in port 2 the button that is not working is probably routed threw to port 3.  you might want to look at the pin outs and see if this is your problem.

The whole thing pictured weighs in at 90-110 lbs, somewhere in that range.

The CG is low enough that we can drive it around all crazy like and not flip (although I could make it do wheelies before we dropped the arm in).

if we get our wheels on another robot and keep driving we could go over.  We can do the little stairs no problem, and if we can et up the 6 in step we have talked abour using the arm as a counterbalance to keep it from going over.

We can get that arm straight up in a few seconds.  Maybe a bit longer to do the precision adjustments nescessary to get the hook on the bar.
This it the tread for 1024.... it runs so smoooooth.. :cool:
We have 33 students and about 30+ adults. I know a few years ago we had something like 50+ kids and it's hard to find that many kids something to do all the time(I have no idea how SPAM can handle having 80 kids). 40 students are a good number to keep the kids engaged enough and efficently get things done.
We have somewhere between 60 and 70 students.  About 20 that work on the robot and 5 that show up all the time.
Depends on what you mean. It would a *huge* security hole if one could launch any program at any time. Imagine if the website launched "del c:\*.*".

However, if you are downloading a file, the web browser can open up an application to view the file based on extension or MIME type.

I also beleive that a java or activeX appliction can launch another application, but you would be required to lower the security settings of your browser.

There are also a few security holes in IE that could be used to do this.

What the...?
"Go! Go! Build a freaking part of the robot. " (Mentor to our team president)

Ok! How did I do that?

Put it all together and ... Do Hokey Pokey.

Ok thats bad.

What did I do?

You guys have to keep me away from the robot.

We have to make the holes more Drilly.

BAD IDEA .....Actually thats pretty funny.

I found a drill bit bigger than a quarter.( Holds up a quarter and a 1 3/4 inch drill bit)

Holy crap whay did you do that!  That was the part that worked!
I just want to thank everyone for their answers. Today was the first time we really got to test our robot with all the systems on it (currently 134#) pulling itself up to the bar. We noticed the compressor had to run almost continuously to keep up. We are aware it is slightly overweight since no weight reduction has been done yet. We didn't want to remove any "realestate" yet in case we have to change anything or remount anything in an area we milled out. We also shortened the tubing to normal lengths to neaten up the robot and very minor weight reduction. We also played around with psi and found out 40#'s is the lowest we can go. The reason I posted this is we were considering adding two compressors to increase volume which in turn would decrease system recharge time if we could get the weight down enough.

As a user, I think that'd be one of the most annoying things ever. What are you trying to do, anyway? Also think of everyone out there on Mac OS, Linux, etc. You won't score big interoperabilty points there.


Ed,

We seem to go through this issue every year. We appreciate the fact that your team has standards for scouting, but perhaps a little more guidance is needed for the students.

Definetly, make sure they start with the FIRST website. I've seen a few cases where people post here for information on a team with contact information on thier website.

Next, show them how to search for members of chiefdelphi. It's gotten more complicated with the upgrade to VB3, so maybe they need more guidance. As Brandon has been diligently pointing out, there are many cases where people are posting before searching for members.

Next, they should use google. Its amazing what type of press coverage or other stuff that can give you contact information.

Lastly, they should post here. If they can't find contact information for multiple teams, they should have all of them listed in the same thread. Also in that thread, they should detail what methods they used to find the team.

One other thing, whomever has access to TIMS on your team can get contact information for any team (or so I'm told). Perhaps you should make that information availible to your students after they show a certain amount of effort in finding that information on their own.



I'll  relay the info to our scout leader.


They don't allow any modifications. I had a nice conversation with a Mr. Ken Freitas about this.



I believe it might have something to do with what you did with the FIRST that is causing you the issues, becuase RAGE was given permission to modify the logo as shown [here.](http://www.geocities.com/j2005k3/index.html) We are using this desing for our Tenth anniversary shirts and our new Hooded sweatshirts. So as long as the changes aren't to do with things such as the way you have FIRST and then the sm it will probably be approved.
This is from the Award info in the manual and on Streamline:

Schools, which have submitted previously but have been disqualified, do not qualify as “Rookie” teams under these Guidelines. Should a “Rookie” team win the 2004 Championship Award there will be no ”Rising Star” Award presented.

So if you have submitted before and got disqualified it seems as if you are not rookies, thats the way I see it.

you know what, i have the exact same problem with the exact same system... except i have a 2.8 ghz p4 ...
My guess is that the match would be down to 2 large balls...or maybe still 3 (including the popped one), but most people aren't planning to be able to manipulate a deflated ball.  Just my opinion.

If you come to Saint Louis regional, we will give you some little marbles.  For free.

You see, to get the big ones (on a short notice without having to get them shipped) you have to buy a package of marbles that contains 300000 little ones and 2 or 3 big ones.

So we have a ridiculous amount of small marbles left over.

The wheel was made like this: we put marks every inch on the wheel, drilled in with a 1/4" hand-held drill, used the press and a 7/8" bit to make the hole, rubber-malleted a 1" marble into the hole.

No glue or epoxy as of now, although it may be added later.  We are still undecided, although we are leaning towards "no."
We have about 25 people on our team and since we get school credit for taking the class, all people are active and attend very regularly.
Correct.
My boyfriend flew home (he's working as a co-op for Kimberly Clark in Paris, Texas) for the weekend. We visited in Appleton on Saturday, then went to Milwaukee for dinner at Mader's German Restaurant. He got me a cute teddy bear and a rose, along with flying home and dinner!!

It was the only good Valentine's day I've ever had. :)
looks like you are going for ball herding.  I see a mount for an arm, so presumably you are going in for hanging and/or large ball manipulation.

It looks like you wont be able to get on the platfor at all; you are too wide to get around the stationary goal (from my experience, anyway, looks like you are 3' wide or so, assuming you are using all of the 3'x2'6") and with those wheels you will have a hard time getting up the step.  If you had more ground clearence, you might be able to, but not as it is now.

But, as you said, it is unfished, so what else can we expect, subsytem-wise?

Oh, a question about your electronics: is it safe to mount them on a conducting surface? We used wood last year because of this (we graduated to LEXAN this year!)
Our team has about 13 members. Most of us show up all the time and usually work hard. However, we dont have any outside help. Our two mentors are teachers at our school (one mostly gets in the way, anyway). For those teams above with small #s of students, do you get outside help or is the work mostly done by the students?
Just my oppinion, but i think its a lot more rewarding to know that a group of students came together to build a robot.
I'd like to know to since this is our first time to the NJ Regional as well...

See you all there!
ditto
Yeah, ball control is our primary strategy.
We do not plan on even touching the platform. So, we designed our drive based on last year's design. It is 3' wide, as you suspected.
We have a plow (similar to last year) for herding. It's a set of wings that extends around 5' wide.
We also have 2 goal hooks for grabbing a goal. You can see the supports on the front of our bot in a few pics.
Finally the arm. It is used for capping. Right now, we're designing it to work just with the mobiles. Once it's complete, if we have the time, we plan to try and expand it to cap the large goals.
As of now it drives like a champ.


we have a total student population of about 25 or so and on average about 10-12 show up and about 5-8 actuly work.




That is not totally correct. We have about 45 members on our team, with around 30 of them being students. We average about 20 students per day, and most of them have something to do for the most part.

It is very difficult to make sure everyone has something to do. I wish someone form SPAM would post.

it looks heavy; are those sprocket steel?

And wood, heavier that aluminum for the same strength, am I safe in assuming this is a prototype?

Looks strong though, Probably looks really cool in action.

Edit: is that a window motor driving a kit gearbox I see? Clever!


Looks very nice. Might I recommend that you lose the Times New Roman font (which I think is the ugliest font ever)...




[Hey, it could be worse.](http://bancomicsans.com/)
I have no idea about the actual anser to your question, but when don't you control it with a relay?  I'm fairly certain that would work, though not a spike relay.

I say get a miniature 5V relay, hook the coil up to the digital output, and hook the other side up to the brake/coast jumper.  I'm assuming this will work, except I have no clue how much current the digital outputs can supply on the signal pins.  Or even if that's how they work.  IFI doesn't have much information on digital outputs on the website.  The realy should work, however, as FIRST talks about using a microswith to control the brake/coast setting.
Top 5 quotes from Saturday:

1.  "I swear..... this time it will work!'

2.  "oh oh... that's the FIRE alarm!"

3.  "sorry about the smoke condition.... a little problem with the saw..hehe"

4. "THE MOTORS GO ON THE OTHER LEFT SIDE NOT THIS LEFT SIDE!"

5. " what do I do with all these extra parts?"
:)
we have 5 that show up regularly, only 2 of which have done anything mechanical before(myself and one other). the 2 of us have only been in FIRST 1 other year.  i am a professional carpeter so our robot is basicly being built like a construction prject.  measure as we go because we cant machine parts or cut things that acurate.

we also have ONLY ONE adult mentor and he can only help once a week at the most.  so, not by choice, the robot is my creation with others helping me.  our robot really isnt any good because of it.


my  biggest problem with a small team is there is no specialization.  especially when most of the people dont know what to do.  monday was the first day were we had enough started(by all of us so everyone knew basicly what was going on for each thing) that a few could work on each thing.  i ran back and forth guiding them.
I don't know if you guys looked at this:

&lt;R13&gt;
In no case, will traction devices that damage the carpet or other playing surfaces be permitted. Traction devices may not have surface features such as metal, sandpaper, or **hard plastic studs, cleats, or other attachments**.

I know it doesn't say anything about glass or marbles but I think that would be up for interpretation. I would ask FIRST before I showed up to a competition like this.


ditto




Definitely no social at this new NJ venue.
I hope one of the awesome FIRST Team(s) (has a 2 and a 5 in their team number) host something special at their school gym (hint hint).
;)


it inserts $@#$@#$@#$@# where I don't need it



Is that Perl? ;)
If you read rules &lt;R01&gt; &lt;R54&gt; and &lt;R70&gt; it is clear that only one compressor (pump) may be used on a robot.

:)

Aidan
uummm

if those are there to give traction then you might have a problem.  Glass marbles aren't exactly sandpaper.  I have a lot of concern for the design.  I guess I'll find out at the St. Louis regionals.  See you there.
Rich, I am slow when it comes to these cryptic clues like the one you gave, do you mean team #25?  :D

j/k


Yeah, thanks for checking that out for everyone, squide!  We'll make sure not to use it now.




You're welcome!

Here's a site I found permission from:

http://www.musicfromouterspace.com/

Ray Wilson is the composer, he has a few songs to look at.  Just email him, and tell him about the competition.  I might use one of his songs or "compose" something myself.  Good Luck!
It's a cool design but I doubt it will pass inspection. You do realize the edges of the platform are diamond plate and the spinning wheel will probably shatter or chip the marbles when it comes in contact with the diamond plate. FIRST won't be too keen on having to bring out an Electrolux and vacuum the field after your match. If you REALLY want to try to use these wheels I would suggest bring another set of wheels without marbles so in case you fail inspection you could change wheels.

The rule is to prevent carpet damage.

Those marbles will not damage the carpet.  They slide, thats what they are there for.  I think the hard plastic studs refers to object designed to dig in and stay put: these exist to make the wheel easy to slide around.  Our back rubber wheels do more damage to carpets that the marbles.  I don't forsee a problem.
Interesting...
Tried driving it yet? It'll probably bounce, but that should be ok.
What are the Huggies for, dare I ask?  :yikes:

I think it would look cool with an anodize on it. It would prevent it from tarnishing and you could chose either a clear or a color for it. The downside to a color is if it gets scratched it would look bad, but them again your robot could show off it's "battle scars".

Those marbles will not damage the carpet.



damaging the carpet is probably not going to be your problems but the problem will be that FIRST will not want to clean it up after every match. if those marbels break

I think you have hit on the real key here.  As the wheels are currently configured, they MIGHT pass inspection.  But the first time they chip on the platform lip and get a sharp edge, they would then pose a damage hazard to the carpet.  At that point, you run the risk of being DQ'd.

My best advise: just in case, take an extra set of un-modified wheels with you, and practise on changing them out real fast!  :)

3 Questions:

1 We misplaced our 40 amp maxi fuse box, so we purchased the stinger 3 sided one, is this ok?

2 Right now, we dont have either the weight, nor the ability to use the ground stem, so we are using the ground block on the mini fuse box (for 20-30 amp fuses).  is this also suficcent?(and legal?)

3 We lack both weight space and product to use the Distrobution block included in the kit.  So we have the breaker split wire to the Maxi and mini fuse box seperately.  i could find nowhere where it posted the distro block as a requirement, does anyone know betteR?


thank you all.




** Start drilling your holes...**

The ground stud is a must use in your robots circuit this year.  Also if you are using the 40 amp breaker from the KOP you need to use the power distrobution block, using other 40amp breakers i would think the same thing is neccessary due to it not only splitting ground connections it also splits your live voltage which you would rather not be splitting from a fuse panel.
go to www.innovationfirst.com they have it there
I am blown away by how awesome that looks. this year's our first attempt at using tracks, so I can safely say it's not nearly as great-looking as that beauty~!  Good job!


What happens if I upload my authrization twice???? :rolleyes:



What authorization are you talking about, your 3D Studio Max authorization code?
Cool looking!  I like the trippy colored marbles, althoug I dont think i'd like them as much if one of them punctured our robots tires after one of your maches...


The rule is to prevent carpet damage.




The rule is prevent field damage, not just carpet damage. It specifically states in the rule, "carpet or other playing surfaces".
Nice drivetrain, George. :)
I think that the level of contreversy this is causing on CD alone is reason enough to check with FIRST to make sure you'll be ok.
Looks cool though. Hope it passes.
We have had at most 40 students show up, and I hate it.  I'm a veteran member of this team, and one of only like 7-8 who have been on the team since our rookie year, while the team is increasing every year.  These people get in the way, half of them I want to hang or smother w/ a pillow.  Then constant arguing has set us back, plus the teachers kicking us at at 4:30 everyday has us still w/o a robot that can power itself. we are unable to organize the team, and we still need to build an arm for our bot, with only a week left, on top of that, our "head" teacher hasn't even made contact with ITT, who mentored a helped us last year. I loved it much better when the first year had like 10 people, when I loved this competition and being with a bunch of guys and girls having fun, now this year just flat out sucks.

yes it is heavy, this pic was taken before we started drilling weight reducing holes

yes it's a steel sprocket

no it is not a protoype, we don't have enough money/ time to build it from metal

yes it is strong

and yes it is a window motor driving a kit gearbox.  The gear ratio on the second stage part of the arm is 1:16.  That window motor will lift the second stage no problem.

due to weight we decided to take out one of the sprockets
It's difficult to see in the picture if those timing belts have a centering bar down the middle that rides in a groove on your timing pulleys.  Do they?

If not, what keeps the timing belt from "walking" off its drive pulleys laterally when misaligned or while turning?

Really good looking wheels but the first thing that came to my mind after reading your method of fabrication is "flying marbles".
Under extreme conditions when the the rubber heats up and the wheels are spinning very fast. I would be afraid that the marbles will come out and go flying.

Something to consider-
From a previous robot inspector
have you seen this site yet? its linked from www.innovationfirst.com FIRST documents page

Team update 9 gives an acceptable source for the MAXI fuse blocks,  As far as your ground question the Rules &lt;19&gt; to &lt;23&gt; don't mention having to use the ground stem, I would double check to make sure you are using the min wire sizes, the same current goes out as comes back,  A too small wire in the ground system is as much a problem as on the supply side.  You might want to post to the first web Q&A section about the ground stem.  The Distrobution block is as far as I can tell from rule 19 is an optional item.  The driving issue is current safety,  That's why they gave us the wiring chart with  min wire sizes on it.  Good luck

i guess we'd definitly fit into the small teams with only 10 people. us, we have one mentor. a teacher from our school.. very helpful in many ways, but not much experience in stuff like this... and thats it. the rest is students whether they work or not is another matter.

and probably faster direction change too. with crab, unless you reverse, it takes time to change the direction.
oh, yeah. but you can't do 'car-like-driving' with this design.
i really like this tho. how much do omniwheels cost? i'm just too lazy to look it up. and we'd never be able to machine any. how will you get up the 6in? stairs?
as cool as it is, I wouldn't think this is the best year to do this tho. maybe im wrong. can't wait to see a real photo!

We teach our girls that they can do anything the guys can do and even do it better. :)


I'm not sure if the IFI initialization routines disable it or not, but the watchdog timer would reset the microcontroller after a certain amount of time, which could cause problems like those you're describing. If you want to make sure that's not the problem, read the 18F8520's datasheet to figure out how to disable the WDT, and toss the necessary assembler code into your program.




Could you tell me where I could find the 18F8520's data sheet? (sorry I am on a rookie team and don't know where too much stuff is.)


The reason I posted this is we were considering adding two compressors to increase volume which in turn would decrease system recharge time if we could get the weight down enough.




For the purposes of your question, I believe that the compressor would be considered under the electronics/motor-pump thread of the parts use flowchart.  Per the flowchart, multiple compressors would not be allowed (ie the second compressor did not come in the kit, and it would be an additional motor/solenoid/pump/actuator, and then lead to the "No, it cannot be used" answer.  Since you are on a veteran team, you also know that in the past FIRST has made it pretty clear that you cannot use multiple pumps.

You should post the question to FIRST for the official answer, but I am fairly sure that it will not be allowed.

I agree with Dave that using a second kit pump would not be allowed.

However, FIRST has said that an off-the-shelf vacuum pump could be used as long as it's powered by a kit motor.  Could an off-the-shelf compressor be used if it's powered by a kit motor?

*That* sounds like a good question to post on the Q&A.
There is no exotic parts list...As long as the material is available to all team at that price it is legal...So if their is a source for titanium load-bearing transfer flanges is available to every team at that price it is legal.  Follow the flow-sheet.
Velcro.

Gotta have velcro.
Well they're not dealing at all with the stairs, from another picture they posted it seems they're hanging from the side and sending a hook up to the bar from there (that big pole swings down to an angle then extends a hook up) i really like this design alot since it will be almost a perfect match for our bot, can't wait to see u guys at ucf!

i don't know if this is right or not, but by using a vacuum pump will not increase any air right? so things won't explode. maybe not. cuz the relief valve(is that what its called?) is ON the kit compressor
john, ya owe me one now ;) hehe CONGRATS!!!
You're not slow, this is complicated.  I used to be in the health research field and "% of students, free lunch" is one of the quickest ways to figure out the "poverty" rate of your school, a statistic that FIRST wants to get a handle on.


If we were to have a robot first aid kit... what do yall think would need to be in it?




Don't forget about electronics and pneumatics. Carry spare pwm cables, wire, crimp connectors, speed controllers, valves, tubing, pneumatic fittings, electrical and teflon tape. Duct tape is illegal on the robot and if the judges catch it you could be disqualified. The best advice I can give you from a seasoned FIRSTer is to look at your robot from different angles and think " If I get hit here what will happen?" A lot of the spare parts comes down to how much can your team afford, have time to machine, and have space to carry. Some teams also purchase and carry spare pneumatic cylinders, if on of those gets dented it's service life is pretty much over with.
Tally-HO!

> or wait! if you're in pontiac, mi does that mean i get to meet this at the regionals?!?!? AWESOME!!


You saw that the post says Pontiac, MI...but that is for the CD47-bot.  Team 1083 is actually in Orlando, FL. (I believe)
It was actually nothing FIRST related (for once).  I was making an Intranet page for my home network and thought it's be cool to be able to launch commmonly used programs from a small navigation bar.  ::shrugs::  Sorry if I offended any of you with a simple question..
Great picture :D

Wish I knew where to catch that kind of fish ;)
Good news!

A small research team from CEU (College of Eastern Utah) is going down to the Arizona Regional as part of the process to figure out if we can get a team going out here in the middle of the black hole for FIRST teams. There are no teams in the state of Utah right now, but may there be one (or more) in the next year or two of we can get the buzz going in the right ears.
We are really excited..

See you all there!

ahh. i see. well, learned something :D
and team chief delphi is in pontiac?
what is the CD-47 bot? automatic thing of some sort?
sorry its off topic. apologize in advance
A dip relay would do the trick for the "jumper" side,  The current the coil draws is a published thing and a long time ago they were avialable from Digi-key.  I would talk to the folks at Innovation First If the digital outs can sink the current.  If you get dip relays get the ones with internal diodes, without diodes, the back emf can fry things, else put a diode as clsoe to the coil wireing as you can.  If all is a go in terms of the rules you may have to use a driver transistor to keep the current to what the controler can do,  OR Use a spike with diodes like called out in the &lt;5.6.3&gt; to drive two relays and avoid the  whole asking permission about hooking directly.  Also the information you seek may be in the user guide for the full size controler.  Good luck
you drive 14 hours to compete at IRI.


I used the code that Wizard posted in the second page and im having a little problem ... i added the eeprom.c and eeprom.h ... and included them ... this is my code right now :



...
writeEE(0x00, "23");







writeEE expects an "unsigned char" type for the data item, but you are passing a string literal (due to the quotations).  Try this:


writeEE(0x00, 23 );

Note also that writing to flash is not instantaneous -- the value won't be ready to read for some period of time.  You should also included a call to


processEEqueue();

somewhere in the main 26.2 ms loop.

It does have a centering track that rides in a groove in the pulleys... we got the tracks from brecoflex..

we used the tracks themselves last year with a different frame and we happy with them.. they did suck a lot of power though.. so we wnet with this frame design and better bearings..

The wheels are made on a rapid prototyper out of abs plastic..


Bored, tired, and waiting for food, so I thought I'd start up this list.

...you skip school to spend eight hours working on your bot.
...you have dreams about robotics.
...you talk about FIRST all day in an attempt to recruit people.
...you no longer have friends outside of your FIRST team.





yeah when people were asking me what i was doing for valentines day i said im going out with my boyfriend FIRST lol yeah get it ha ha!!  :yikes:
- Team 870
- 3rd Year
- 2 Drill Motors set in high speed
- 6 9" Pneumatic Skyway wheels
- 2 6" Skyway solid wheels
- #35 chain with 60 tooth sprockets on wheels, (4) 14 tooth idlers, and 11 tooth sprockets on extended drill motor shafts
- Standard Drill Transmission
- Tank Drive
- None as of now
- Speedy, plenty of pushing power. Only problem is that it tends to bounce when doing a ZTR turn.
- Next Year: Would like to try a gear box incorporating the CIM and Drill Motors
what, hanging out with us isn't enough for you?
A HUGE THANKS! to Random Dude and Wizard of AZ for this code.  It works great, and it saved me HOURS, nay, DAYS of work.  And I really needed it.  I bet a lot of people do.

-Norm
i betcha the catalac engeneers had fun with that one. maybe you should let the kids do some work, eh?
I have to say, that is one of the nicest tread design systems I have seen in recent years, congrats!
we should be hanging around with team GUS...rage and paragon - if u want to get together post here or PM me
sweater
it looks great... just make sure you can get to your program and tether ports! man i wish i had that much room to lay the electronics out! keep up the good work
we can fit 20+ balls in our hopper and control the 2x ball.. w0-0t w0-0t
I know each year, my team spends the time between shipping and competition to make extra shafts and such (I think this year we made about 2 extra shafts for every 1 on our bot totally around 20-30?). Besides that, we have organizers for our electronics (solder, connectors and such), spare parts, pneumatic fittings, metric bolts/nuts, standard bolts/nuts, along with just about every tool we used to build it (unfortunately, we can't bring our mill or lathe with us  :( ). Basically I'd say bring anything that you think will happen during the competition. Dremels, Vice Grips, allen keys, wrenches, and everthing else you can bring for repairs is recommended.

And remember, if you don't have a tool at the competition, don't be afraid to ask another team! The past 2 years, my team has lent out so many tools to teams that did not have them, and it's nice to help another team get their robot back in shape to compete!
if the rules allow it, the easiest thing to do would be to have a contact switch that you close with one of the little servos they gave us.
I wasn't offended. I just thought that this wouldn't go over very well in the context of a robotics team site.
Team 973 is going this year for the first time. We are all looking forward to some great copmetition and meeting new teams. But we AREN'T looking forward to the 10 hour bus ride from california.
I really don't see how you can get the programming/tether cables into the controller with those cables going to the speed controllers there (granted it may jsut be a bad angle). Also on the main breaker, it doesn't look like you'll have an easy time getting to the reset switch, which FIRST officials always makes a big deal about.


You saw that the post says Pontiac, MI...but that is for the CD47-bot.  Team 1083 is actually in Orlando, FL. (I believe)





yes we are located in unversity high school, orlando, Fl.



good luck this year,
fear the emoticons.
i wouldnt be so quick to think that the engineers did all the work. You dont really know untill you see the team in action. But.. for the teams where it is obvious that students are only .1% involved.. it makes me mad because FIRST isnt about who can have the most expenisve and fancy looking robot. Its about kids going out, getting **help** from engineers, and building a robot. Not engineers and adults doing everything. And for the kids on these kinds of teams... i know how you feel. Our team was engineer run until this year. The kids have done everything this year, and eve though it isnt pretty (Pvc...) i think that we will go out and compete twice as hard because it is our work and our pride out on the line..


ok i've gotten this to work.. but how exactly would i use this in my code?




This isn't intended to be used *in* the code.  It's intended to save you time if you're putting lookup tables into your code.  Here's how I use it...  First I use the spreadsheet/math functions in Excel to generate the values for my lookup table (for example, y = sin(x)).  Then to save me the trouble of manually typing each and every lookup table value into my code I wrote that little macro to just dump all the values into a .txt file.  Then I open the text file and copy and paste the lookup table into my code.  It's just a time-saving device.  It really proves its worth for another use though.  We use a non-linear transfer function in the form of a lookup table to de-sensitize our joysticks (see [this ](/t/desensitizing-joysticks/49324/1) thread).  Using Excel we can model the shape of the function to tailor the joystick response to the driver's liking.  The automated generation of the lookup table saves us time so that we can quickly prototype new functions and dump the lookup table into the code during the testing phase.

Anyway, hopefully you can find a use for it and it saves you some time.

Cheers,
yeah and if your not into servos and contact swiches.... just get a 5v dpdt relay, hook it up to (1) digital output and *vwala* perfect switching. the Victor 884 uses a pic microprosseser to control the fets in the HBridge, and its not going to be exsessive current at all. just remember to put it all in a box :P


even though i cringe when someone else says it here it goes...

DUCT TAPE, that would be equal to a bandaid

maybe some GREESE to be the antibiotic




Duct tape isn't allowed on the robot as a nondecorative device.
A quote that made me laugh: "All together, this robot will weigh 80-90 pounds."  (Our base with sprockets and stuff is 30).
zip ties will fix ANYTHING.

and who sais that just because its holding your drive motor on that the ducttape is nondecrotiave?
here's some basic java that we use on our site


&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
//change your event date event here.
var eventdate = new Date("Feb 26, 2004 12:00:00 PST");

function toSt(n)
{s=""
if(n&lt;10) s+="0"
return s+n.toString();
}

function countdown()
{cl=document.clock;

if(count&lt;=0)
{cl.days.value ="----";

love doin that  ;)
I think the point of the "listen to" image you have is to take info from your local media player and show what you are listening to at any given point when you are surfing the web.

I don't think it acts as a player itself, unless I am mistaken.

i no but, like a cd? i put in my cd n itll show?


I wasn't offended. I just thought that this wouldn't go over very well in the context of a robotics team site.



This particular sub-forum is not only for you to " Show off your team's website", but also to "Ask for help with HTML, PHP, CSS, XML, and other website related topics".  Please don't make any unnecessary and, in this case, wrong, assumptions.  That's not good posting ettiquette.  Next time I will make it a point to be more specific, though.  So there, a lesson learned for all of us.

Anywho, does anyone have a solution to this problem?  Is it possible?
Thanks, I'll check it out. I was informed by someone else that it looked identical to the other MOS browsers in Safari. The weird 90-degree white thing is part of the title, which is absolutely positioned. I forgot to make it transparent, I think. The fact that the background is off I'll have to look into. Thank you.
From what I can gather (I don't have it installed) it reads info somehow off of the ID3 tags that are encoded with mp3 files.  I don't know if it can read audio cd's??

Will someone who uses this application please read this thread!! lol
nice work! how many pieces is it total? i count 10...

Yeah, I was wondering about that.  I thought it was my problem - that somebody else has it makes me think it's not.  IFI might have goofed, you never know...

> and team chief delphi is in pontiac?
> what is the CD-47 bot? automatic thing of some sort?


Chief Delphi is in Pontiac and the CD-47 bot automatically starts threads when people want to discuss certain pictures or other things on the site.
That is definitly amazing, I'm still in awe! With all those switches and functions on your robot you must have a really good programmer(s) on your team. What did you use for the custom labels? Do you have a label maker or is it paper or vinyl glued to the board? We've used the old standby in the past, the Sharpie. Although effective it lacks the appeal.
I am amazed at how many CT teams we are going to have at NJ "representing"!


Muwhahahahaha!  This should be fun!!

BTW, Where is everyone staying???
Maybe that will give us some options to hang out together after hours!
I don't know where we are staying yet though...
yeah i would think you would want to hold them in with **something** if not epoxy then silicon rubber or even hot glue! and consider replacing the marbles with say teflon bals... glass is nasty when it shatters
our captains are the team mentors son and his friend....  :mad:
hey "the clock".. do u happen to be the house manager from werewolves at the haunted graveyard.. i know a bunch of the team members worked there and u kinda look like the guy
Listen-To doesnt provide music to listen to.

You can listen to music using your favorite media player (Winamp, Windows Media Player, iTunes, xmms, etc) and depending on which player you choose it can keep track of mp3s, wavs, wma, m4p, audio cds, and more.

If you need help, though, I'd use the 'Contact Us' link on Listen-To.com, or send me a PM, rather than posting out here.

If that frame around the wheel prevents the wheel from contacting the diamond plate, you should be in better shape.  So if that frame is below 6" tall, I think you might be ok.  It is still a hard call.  And it you were planning on climbing the stairs, you could use the other two wheels (probably climb better than marbled-wheels anyway).

Edit - The frame would have to be really low, because of the smaller steps.

"**Tailgating** is not permitted and GUESTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO ENTER THE FACILITY AS SOON *as* GATES OPEN. "

**BUT**[size=2]it also says stuff about not allowing signs and banners, so take this with a grain of salt till you hear from the UTC regional directors or someone similar.[/size]

Considering the fact that this is an event that is taking place during the
"off season" of the venue I am assuming it is not allowed but hoping that it just may be.

BTW if it is allowed, count on Team 237 to be participating in some tailgating!
The hubs for the wheels are pretty complex.. a few kids spent weeks on a lathe... but the bearing fit perfectly and it is all very solid..
I would say 20 - 30 parts total.... I am sure we will use these for years...
Am I seeing things, or is that the A-Team van in the parking lot?! :ahh: :D
yeah i see no reason why you shouldent be able to wire up 2 single's with one spike. just put the diodes in a box :P
we'll be there
I think you are seeing things, cause all I see is a box with a red X in it...
(broken link)
:(
we have 9 students on our team ... 2 teachers who have recently (in the past two weeks) become a little bit involved .. and 4 mentors/engineers ... we work really well together ... most of us students show up to meetings (anywhere from 6-9 at a meeting). we joke around a lot and know a lot about each other personally ... some of us are connected outside of the team as well which helps.

as to which i like better .. i like a team of 10 because you become really good friends and as a result more gets done .. i was on a team of about 20 last year .. and i think that thats the maximum there should be because after that1 (and even then) some people are just sitting around

edit/ it also depends on how your team is organized .. our engineers used to have a rule (when there were 13 people) on the team, that only 6 could show up at a time because any more would be less productive and they were not able to watch over 13 of us at a time ... this might be a good rule for some of the larger teams (40- 50) people to enforce but maybe with 12 people instead ...  but then again it all depends on your team
yeah, i got excited and started the discussion thread before approving the picture.  now i know - thats a bad thing to do. :)

all fixed now.
You better believe its the A-team van...
Oo-Oh Me Me! :D

Your probably waiting for someone to post something arn't you.
It'd be a good idea to make some kind of pocket or shelf on your cart (for tools, etc) so you can make adjustments on the fly.. this is particularly helpful during playoffs, as you might need to replace something on the field.. we stocked our cart with the most essential allen wrenches/etc last year and that paid off as one of our sprockets actually broke during the championship semifinals but we got it back on within 5 minutes..

Look at your bot (in our case we use extruded aluminium) and see which sizes of what tools you need the most. Go to some local tool store and buy 20 or so in that size, you can never have enough..

also, make sure you have something along the lines of a leatherman/knife, so many things can go wrong.. I still remember how in 2001 we discovered we had an illegal motor right as we were going on the field, so one kid spent 5 good minutes clawing at the motor trying to get its cables detached. One good hack with a knife would've done it.
yes... i caught that right after u posted


i betcha the catalac engeneers had fun with that one. maybe you should let the kids do some work, eh?




You really need to get your facts straight before you go accusing teams of having their robots created only by engineers.  Truck Town produces a great quality robot every year, and they work just as hard if not harder than anyone else.  Again, think before you type and get your facts straight - we all put a lot of work and effort into this competition, and basically you're saying because someone put a lot of time and effort into something to make it look great, that it was built by engineers only.  :mad: I'm offended.

You Constant (#define) can be a floating point value.
but....
when you apply it in your program  the result will be an int.
ie.

#define CONSTANT 1.5

int adjust_speed(int speed_in)
(
int speed_out;
speed_out = (speed_in/CONSTANT);
return speed_out;   //sends back an int
)




however, the floating-point constant forces the processor to do floating point math, which is slower. in this case, using

#define CONSTANT 3/2

is better, because the processor can use integer math, which is faster.
Whatever it is, I bet it's awesome...  :]

HOW DOES THE AOUTONOMUS PROGRAM WORK WE CAN`T MAKE OURS WORK PLEASE HHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLPPPPPPPP SOMEONE ANY ONE????:ahh:  :confused:




whew. calm down, take a deep breath. now, tell us what problems you're having. if I told you a program "wasn't working" and didn't say anything more, could you even begin to fix it? we need more information.
The officially-sanctioned method, as suggested by IFI in the Victor 884 User's Guide, involves using servos and SPDT switches. I'm not sure if there are other methods that would be safe and successful, but that seems to be the one they encourage.
Here's a way of doing this with IE and JavaScript:


<HTML>
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript" LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
function executeCommands()
{
// Instantiate the Shell object and invoke its execute method.
var oShell = new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application");
var commandtoRun = "C:\\Windows\\Notepad.exe";
// Invoke the execute method.
oShell.ShellExecute(commandtoRun, "",
"", "open", "1");
}
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CENTER>
<Input type="Button" name="cmdNote"
value="Run Notepad" onClick="executeCommands();"  />
</CENTER>
</BODY>
</HTML>


Once you save this as an HTML file and open it in IE, you can run Notepad by clicking the button. A security warning should pop up. If you want to get rid of it, modify security settings for the Local Intranet zone to allow "opening programs in an IFRAME". Be very careful when doing this. There are known (and unknown yet :)) bugs in IE that could allow an internet page to appear as if it is on the intranet. Check what security zone Outlook is in too if you use it (it should be in Internet by default, but check anyway :)) Well, you have been warned :D

You can use this technique to open any file (it does not have to be executable). And there are similar techniques for interacting with Word, Excel, etc. And by the way, I found this script on this page originally: [http://www.midrangeserver.com/mpo/mpo052302-story01.html](http://www.midrangeserver.com/mpo/mpo052302-story01.html)
I'm a hardcore addict...but then again I'm a college student.  I don't have to fight dial-up so I can refresh that many more times.  I like when you see your name like five plus times on the portal w/o scrolling down.  I wouldn't be so addicted if I was with a team during the week.  I'm too far away so I go two hours home on the weekends to help.  During the week I'm held in suspense so I come see what's on here since my team is kind of against posting too many picture...arrgh, oh well.  But they really need to come out with a CD patch or gum...
okay.

servos are $30 bucks each. relays are free.
servos and switches are exsesivly prone to failure.
servos eat up power...
servos are **huge** compared to relays.

with all that said, yes its the "offical" way to go. will our team do it? uh no


we can fit 20+ balls in our hopper and control the 2x ball.. w0-0t w0-0t



post me a picture and I'll believe you.


You better believe its the A-team van...




So...if you *found* the A-Team, does that mean that you can now *hire* them?


Could you tell me where I could find the 18F8520's data sheet? (sorry I am on a rookie team and don't know where too much stuff is.)




Datasheet: http://www.microchip.com/download/lit/pline/picmicro/families/18fxx20/39609b.pdf

It assumes you're already familiar with assembler programming, though, so it might be kinda difficult to understand.
i'll have one for you on tuesday (next meeting)
i am .. i am online a lot ... especially when i should be working (like now) ... and i would be online at meetings too if i could access CD .. but i cant so im not ....
i am deff and addict
i'll just sit wait and watch the portal for sumthing new and interesting
When you have 3 pieces of bosh extruded alumimum and a pair of safty glasses on top of your computer screen.
I'm not saying that other methods are wrong. I'm just saying that the servo method is the one suggested by IFI.

For the record, you can draw 1 ampere total from all of the analog output and digital I/O Vcc pins. If you're not powering a lot of other stuff from those, using small relays should be fairly safe.
but here's a ghetto mock-up of what we kinda want to do<br><br>![Set73_02.jpg|640x480](upload://ex5gfguAuxw3CXdusAPHTaOE0w3.jpeg.jpeg)<br>![Set73_04.jpg|640x480](upload://czlULwAkzQJXpTElh5ZRd7Qf7Jl.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![Set73_02.jpg|640x480](upload://ex5gfguAuxw3CXdusAPHTaOE0w3.jpeg.jpeg)<br>![Set73_04.jpg|640x480](upload://czlULwAkzQJXpTElh5ZRd7Qf7Jl.jpeg.jpeg)<br>

We get to give away the 100,000th point in FIRST Jeopardy history tonight!  So I figure I may as well make the question related to FIRST Jeopardy, so for 500 (and this may require a little searching through past threads), the correct answer to the first question in FIRST Jeopardy history that no one got credit for.  And I'll give you a hint, don't bother checking May.


very nice...are you at all worried about getting hit?



That is not our final product! Side panels and painting have yet to commence :yikes:
We finally got driving yesterday - well, techincally, 12:30 this morning. No problems except for the drills coming out of gear a couple of times, and a couple of belts falling off their pulleys because we haven't bothered to re-attach the flanges that fell off while boring through them. Our Tri-Stars handled the 6" step like a dream.
LOL, you guys are so funny. Today we're working 10a-10p. Looking forward to seeing your robot and all of you.
That might explain why our solenoids weren't working saturday night, and they worked on sunday morning when mentor put black to M+ and red to M-

[quote]&lt;R08&gt; Robots must use all four Team Color LEDs provided in the kit to display their alliance color (red or blue).
Previous years rotating lights are not allowed. All four Team Color LEDs must be mounted on the robot
such that their displayed color is visible over the entire 360 degree circle around the robot from a distance
of at least 100 feet. Instructions for connecting the lights are provided in the Innovation First controller
manual. The Robot Controller directly powers and controls the Team Color LEDs. The user has no
control over the Team Color LEDs and no programming is required
[quote][/quote]



Does anyone know if First released a spec for the new light placement on the robots this year?

In the past there was only one light, we wondered if there was documentation on the placement of the lights. Like one per side since there are four lights or anything like that too read. We can't find any documentation that would point this out if this has been defined or not. Any pointers would be grateful.




Rule &lt;R07&gt; Robots must display their team number, sponsor and school names, and/or logos. The judges, referees,
and announcers must be able to easily identify robots by Team Number. Teams must display their Team Number in four locations at approximately 90-degree intervals around the side of the robot. The numerals must be at least 4 inches high, at least in 3/4 inch stroke width and in a contrasting color from its background. Team Numbers must be clearly visible from a distance of not less than 100 feet.
**not a real answer**

I think I saw somewhere that said you had to mount them in 90 degree's apart from each other... (if their are 4?)

So, on all 4 side of your robot, like the team number.
(I think)

She hasn't mentioned it to me since, and they missed last night (when they said they'd be here). I'll ask them about it next time I see them. Thanks!

I also noticed that your HI-AMP breaker switch is covered.  Thats against the rules.  It was my understanding that the breaker needed to be uncovered and easily accesible.  Im also not posotive but your modification of the MAXI fuse block may also be considered tampering with a component and be against the rules


With all those switches and functions on your robot you must have a really good programmer(s) on your team. What did you use for the custom labels? Do you have a label maker or is it paper or vinyl glued to the board?




We have an excellent student programmer who's been on the team since his freshman year, and this is his senior year. He's working constantly. Our school is the only school in the nation with a student run ISP, and he was a network manager there in his junior year.

I don't know what was used for the labels. I'll have to ask a couple of people who aren't here right now, and I'll let you know.


How are we suppose to wire the cable for the pressure switch to make the compressor turn off.  Do we use PWM cables and if so what is the pinout.  I am also unsure of how to code the pressure switch in the new controller.  Please post your ideas.  Thanks





The default code already has INPUT 18 assigned to the pressure switch, and RELAY 8 assigned to a SPIKE relay per say that would be wired to the compressor.

Is it legal to cut off the connector for the van motor?




Are you talking about the door, seat or window motors?  In any case i see no problem with that since adapters are not always available and/or supplied.
Sweet...thanks guys. That was a FAST reply!
why would you want more pressure on the retract then the extend.  In pneumatics like we have there is no real "speed control" or "stroke distance control" that we have by limiting pressure input on different sides.
thanks

you could use the 2ndary regulator on one of the pneumatic lines downstream from the solenoid valve.

NOTE: im not entirly sure how this would work thoug, i dont know how air reacts passing backwards through the reg. I am under the impression it gets vented, but it might restrict flow then. try it!
862 has a student vote for our President  which is the same as a team captain.  There are nominations before hand.  Usally students who will be Seniors and Juniors are the ones nominated.  And for the past two years its been a senior who has been our President.
We hold our elections at the end of the school year so the new President is in office for the summer before the Build and Competition seasons that they will be in office for.
Sorry for not replying sooner - I've been at robotics all weekend until now.

Those wheels weigh ten pounds each, and we are using two in the front, with two six-inch wheels in the back.

We actually designed the sides of the plates that way (not straight) , only because we found that the metal would touch the corner of the step while we were climbing it. It's not a curve, just either two or three seperate straight sides that meet to form corners. We got the plates, shafts and wheel hubs machined professionally (I'm not sure what method they used, but the plates look pretty sweet up close).

The turning is very good, considering all eight of our wheels are made of neoprene rubber.

Hope that answers all your questions.
To put them on your robot you don't need alot of space and its 0% effort to mount. Most robots if not all will be in a 4 sided shape (square / rectangle) all you need to do is put 1 led on each side of the robot and high enough so that its visible but well proctected from any significant damage !

in te kit of parts *not sure what they are called* there are little pressure regulators that attach to either end of the piston. The are whit and orange and have a little turny knob on the top for adjusdments. Put those on and tweak around with that.

First stated to save weight, you may remove some of the fuse panels on the maxi panel breaker, they each connect by 2 or 4 screws on the bottom side.  At competition, you should always have your removed panels for replacment.

I don't mean to criticize your design, but just maybe improve(?) it.

I think it would be better if your Team name and number and the text in the oval to be a contrasting color than the oval  - or at least outline it somehow.

THe second regulator would be your best choice.  It should work but just test it.
Well, I might email Mr. Freitas back about that, because his reply certainly didn't seem to agree with what you just said. Perhaps he was having a bad day....

--Petey
those are not pressure regulators, those things are called "Flow Controls". They allow the flow of the air passing OUT of the piston to be controlled. They can be used as 1 way valves to, because air in is unefected, and air out can be cut off when the valvr is all the way closed.
That is machined very well.  Im not sure what that guy is thinking.:)  Anway have you tested the wheels yet? Also,  why did you guys go for the gears instead of chains?  The weight probably would have been cut down and it would have simplified the whole process.
The suggested method is one we have used over the years.  A servo with the cross attachment is mounted in such a way that when it turns it bumps into a microswitch that is wired across the brake pins on the speed controller.  Controlled from software the servo either closes the switch or opens it.
Just put a link to the movie in in an EMBED or OBJECT (this one is better) tag. It should work in any browser, especially if you nest the tags (put EMBED inside OBJECT, just like Flash files). A better idea is to simply provide a link to the file. Movies take time to download, so its better to make it up to the user to decide. By the way, you can put video in Flash files (Flash MX and up). The compression is excellent, and everyone has the plugin. You can easily convert your mpegs to flash.

> why would you want more pressure on the retract then the extend. In pneumatics like we have there is no real "speed control" or "stroke distance control" that we have by limiting pressure input on different sides


Well, you're 1/2 right. True, you can not regulate stroke distance with pressure. You CAN regulate the speed at which the piston moves (and it can be different extending and retracting) with the small fittings that have the white knobs.
You also CAN create a very simple multi-positioning setup with parts from the kit. This will allow you to extend a piston part of the way and stop.
You typically do this by using 2 selenoids. One double, and one Single.
We did this last year, I can't entirely remember the setup.
But It's not difficult, or space consuming or anything


> please spell check all posts before posting

I don't see where we could have used chains... seems like it would be a pain to tension them.

We did test the wheels, and they are performing beautifully, except that we haven't yet put delrin sliders or something else on the bottom of the 'bot, and so we can't get more than halfway up the step for now.
I hate the embed tag!!!  It takes forever to load the page then with an embedded video file.

ahh oh well im not too worried about my spelling... i know i can type right but im usually just to lazy to go back and fix my lazy online talk
I was the team captain of 522 the way i got selected to be one was the coaches watched me cafefully. they acknowleged me helping them with paper work and visually saw me getting the team members to do some much needed work around our room. they all said to one another that short kid might have some potential in leading the team to some sort of success   :D  which i in no doubt in their minds did. one of the coaches came up to me and asked if i would be interested in giving it a shot. said yes and led the team for about a year and 1/4. And just so that there was no fight over whos boss of who there are 4 coahces. (1 programmer, 1 electrician / machinist,
1 designer &lt;-----hes the official team captain , 1 machinist / welder.) The student captain just relays info to the student body and helps the big captain out with his tasks let alone lead the team in the right direction.

They have since then selected new team captains since i graduated using a slightly different method but with the same idea. usually students really don't have much of a say on who chooses to be a captain b/c anyone of us could call  ourselves a captain. it really should be up to a coach to decide who leads the team for the simple fact that they know what to look for in a captain. however the student body has and reserves the right to make complaints about the captain and what how he is leading the team.


AS far as judges going to students first thats true at most competitions b/c they wanna see and hear what the student has learned and done for the team not what the coach has learned and done. espicially for the rookies that have come in. I think thats how a teams should get some awards. Design awards should be given to teams who have the team members talk to the judges about the insides and out top to bottom about how their robot works and has been designed. coaches can add a few words but not enough to throw off the judges vote. The FIRST competition is about teaching the younger generation things they never knew or improve their current knowledge of certain aspects.

Hello All,
The wiring diagram (schematic) shows the wiring for this year.  If you use 40 amp circuit breakers you must use the distro block and the 4 way maxi block or allowed equivalent.  One of the Q&A responses allow you to remove the unused section of both the distro block and the maxi fuse block.  All teams must use the ground stud. If you use the maxi fuse block, the grounds for those motors must come back to the distro block just as shown in the diagram and return to the stud via #6..
Well I was trying to think of a way to limit the amount of air we lose when you lift ourselves onto the bar. We would still need the 60 psi (actually would it be better to have the retract only exert 130 lbs of force??) to lift, but do we really need 75 cu In at 60 psi to be lost just to extend the piston?
There is a meeting during off season that we hold where we discuss captainship and how we want it to be addressed each year. Both last year and this year, we decided to go with co-captainship and a vote is taken, private ballot and with two votes per person. This year, I was elected as one of the co-captains. Being a Senior in my oppinion is not key, but having experience with the competition and having people skills and leadership skills are very important in my oppinion  ;)

> I don't see where we could have used chains... seems like it would be a pain to tension them.

The chains would serve the same purpose as the gears.  The only reason what I could think of using them is the weight.


I have written my own Interrupt handler for reading the optical encoders. Is there an easy way to see how many instructions the C Code translates to?


Yes, there certainly is. Have a look at the .lst file that the compiler generates. It's a text file that shows you what assembly and machine code the compiler generated and where it placed it in memory.

Al thanks for the update.
The ground stud is a required part of the electrical system.  It may not be eliminated or substituted.  The electrical system drawing must be followed unless you do not use the maxi block and 40 amp circuit breakers.
Yeah, I agree w/ you elgin, we need a new one. This was actually the logo we made before we knew our team number for the 2003 season. So, we didn't have much info to put in it. But it's all we have so far. I'm hoping to make a newer one soon. Maybe during no-man's time (shipping-competition)
EDIT: So my guess at your intent was wrong.  And four other people replied while I was typing this.  However, maybe this post with have intrinsic value to someone else.  Consider it a recap.

I'm going to sort of ignore your question, because I've got a feeling you're asking how to dodge the 10ft/sec rule with a piston bar hanger.  I assume that what you're trying to do is actually control piston extension and retraction *speed*.  If thats the case, using a regulator to restrict pressure for the extension is only indirectly going to solve your problem.  NoRemorse's flow controls screw directly onto the pistons, and will allow you to adjust stroke speed without effecting force.

If you really want to restrict *pressure* for whatever reason, and you fully realize that this will have only indirect impact on piston speed, you'll need that second full blown regulator.


im sorry if i offended you; what i ment to say was your controller looks great. however catty parts dont just magicly apear.




T3 is sponsored by General Motors.  I would assume those parts are readily available.

Anytime a team's integrity is questioned on these forums, it turns into either a huge flame war or at least a few bitter posts.  I would hope you'll keep your judgement to yourself, and at some point during the season, visit their pit and talk to them about some of your concerns, or read about one of their mentors [here.](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/ufh.php?action=honoreedetail&id=12)

During the IRI this past year, T3 students and mentors helped us rebuild our machine.  I was very impressed with their friendly demeanor and the students' willingness to help.  I can personally vouch for them, as can many people on this forum.
As an answer to the original question, if a secondary regulator downstream of the double solenoid doesn't work because of the directionality of the regulator, you could always use two single solenoids and have one supplied by the secondary regulator.

Also note:  I recall accidentally hooking a regulator up backwards once, and it completely failed to regulate pressure, so I think the regulator after the double solenoid should work.  If you want to have more than one cylinder set up like this, single solenoids would be the way to go since I think you're limited to just the regulators in the kit.

Also, to everyone else, I can think of one good reason to set up a cylinder like this.  If you know for certain that you don't need 60psi on the retract and only need 30psi, setting the system up like this could potentially save you a lot of stored air and battery power, depending on how often you cycle the cylinder.  It works out to about a 25% savings for every extend-retract cycle. That could potentially be very important.

Edit:
I'm a slow typist, but I swear I thought of that before he posted his intentions.  Honest.
Not exactly trying to dodge the 10 ft/sec rule. It was more of a way to reduce the amount of air we exhaust when we extend the piston so we don't need to wait 30 seconds for the system to gain enough pressure to fully retract the piston.

Ahh much thanks.. We are all forum hawks tonight.
Well...who knows how many times we have hooked our compressor up "backwards" then.  The pneumatics manual gave a warning about not putting reverse voltages through the compressor, but i have not seen any problems (the PSI steadily increases, regardless).
Well, this is the info I can give you.

1) The piston has the most force when extended (you probably knew this though)

2) In this situation I don't know what you are trying to do makes sence. Are you regulating down the pressure it uses one way to below 60, or do you want it to be more on one side. I believe that you may only use 60psi on the cylenders.

3)If you want one side at 60psi, and the other at a lower, you may need 2 seperate solenoids to accomplish this.......

The only allowed battery chargers are the six amp smart charger or equivalent 6 amp charger.  In the past FIRST shipped a 4 amp smart charger that does OK but takes longer to charge.

&lt;R19&gt; The 12v Battery may only be charged by a 6 Ampere rated battery charger between matches. When recharging Kit batteries, you may use the charger provided by FIRST or one with equivalent charging current.

I am *technically* a captain this year.  Only, we don't call them captains (okay, so our advisor doesn't call us captains... everyone else does).

Either way, our advisor selected three of us last year and put us in charge of 1)Chairman's and Marketing, 2)Webpage and Animation, and 3)Robots.  The kids just kinda went along with it.  I am a junior, and so is Krystine, and Brenton is a senior.

Age shouldn't matter.  We were picked because of what ee brought to the team.  That should be all that matters.
The servo method does have one thing going for it.  The servo should stay in position after power is cut to your robot.  I think.  I'm not an electronics guy on the robot, but if the power to the servo gets cut then it will definitely stay in position.


Well, I might email Mr. Freitas back about that, because his reply certainly didn't seem to agree with what you just said. Perhaps he was having a bad day....

--Petey



I wouldn't neccisarily do that becuase it seems like he was pretty sure as to what he was talking about.  It could be that becuase you were not modifying it for something such as a shirt or something like that he said no versus making the modification on a website and altering it that much so that the FIRST sm no longer looks like what they request.  It seems that they want a uniform image when linking to their website.  I am not sure though, altho I do believe it goes into more detail in section two of the FRC 2004 manual about what they will and will not accept and allow in terms of modifications made.
I understand your intent now... your clarification got sandwiched in between my read and my write.  I don't know what your mechanism actually looks like, but would it be possible to leave one side of your pneumatic vented and just use a bit of surgical tubing for the extension?
I'm not sure what the technical term is, but I know I've played with cylinders that had a spring loaded extension and a pneumatic retraction.  I couldn't tell you if those components are FIRST-legal, but you might be able to cobble a reasonable facimile together.  Then again it might not be worth the added complexity.
Wow.....that is sick. Someone on your team needs to try out as a space shuttle pilot spot if they can keep track of that much stuff.
that should work, but i dont know how fast the regs bleed off pressure when the air flows backward thriygh them. by puuting them before a solenoid (which requires 2 soleniods) you get a quick dump of rpessure and a MUCh quicker acting piston

But i have never tested this, the flow of air back through the reg may be suffecient for your applicatrion!


another ? can i hook all the sensors to the same ground.  it would make thinks a bunch easier




We don't think it makes things easier.  If you are making your own plugs, you want the extra pins in place to hold the connector body on the RC pins.  If you have modified a PWM cable to splice to the sensor, you would want to have a single cable in case the PWM cable goes bad.  For best noise isolation, it is best to run a parallel ground lead with the sense lead since the flow of current is from the RC power supply back to the RC ground system.
There is a way to retract the cylinder using no air at all - leave the other end of the cylinder open - no connection, and use a small spring or the surgical tubing to retract the cylinder

then you only need a single valve to pressurize the business end, and when you close the valve it will vent the air, and the surgical tubing will retract the cylinder.
I think using the single solenoid off a secondary regulator would work best. Just shorten all your tubing so it will regenerate pressure quicker.  You don't need to worry about flow controls all that will do will slow down your cyclinder and not reduce amount of air used.

I think he wants to extend and then retract Ken.

edit: But I imagine it would work the other way too

> There is a way to retract the cylinder using no air at all - leave the other end of the cylinder open - no connection, and use a small spring or the surgical tubing to retract the cylinder


GREAT POINT!!

this might be exactly what your are looking for because one way uses no gas consumption.
you really should insulate your battery terminal terminal posts with shrink wrap and/or electrical tape so there will be no chance of a short circuit.

where do you get these free relays from?

I will take 10 million please :c)

if you are talking about the relay spikes that are in the KOP - you cannot use those to control the brake pins - the spikes put out 12V switched plus or minus, and they need power on their input (+12V) to work.  they dont get their power from the PWM cables.

Yes, but unfortunately the surgical tubing doesn't provide the retracting force we need. We are trying to save air on the extend. If you look at the picture you may see more clearly why we want to save air

Gentlemen, I think we should all take a big step back from this forum for the night.  I've never seen a room full of guys who were all to tightly on the same wavelength!

That or we all need to learn to type faster.

Looking at your robot, getting an elastic extension does look like a pretty hairy engineering problem.  It could be done... but I'd hate to tac anything onto such a simple mechanism.[/quote]
The team captain isn't something that sould be voted on. It kinda bothers me that some teams vote on it.

Here's my take: The captain just for practical purposes has to be one of the operators, If they are to act as the alliance captain they have to be on the field. That immediately narrows it to three (or four in some cases) people. If one of the drivers is not **obviously** the team captain then it should be the main driver.

If a captain does not ooze captain qualities in their every action then what is the use of electing someone? and if they do so obviously ooze, then why should you have to give them a title?
Yeah you can switch ken's model to extend with no air and then retract.
It's hard to explain well though.

Yeah tough, how does your mechanism set when it is extended or is the 24"cyclinder the bulk of the extension.


I completely agree.  Whoever is the hardest working for the team should be the leader...




me too. age has NOTHING to do with it. i'm still a sophomore and a captain. at least everyone on my team can say i have done the most... tho still not enuf...

The bottom piston retracts to lift the bulk of the arm vertical. Then the 24'' piston extends to hook on. Then retracts to lift off the ground, currently this takes about 1 - 1.5 min with one accumulator.

You will also have to configure you mta for virtual hosting capabilities. As far as your users, they just have to have a sytem login.

That's virtual mail hosting in a very very small nutshell, it should give you a few places to start on google.

Might you ship with your subsititute and then put the real stud in at your first regional?  This way, your robot can be approved by FIRST during practice day and you have a fully functional 'bot.

Hope you get your parts soon!
Our students participation determines grade since this is a for credit class, for all quarters.  The entire team meets on Monday nights to get weekly assignments, work on projects and the mini competition (fall through December) and give and get sub team weekly reports during robot season.  We have 75 registered students, but we don't have perfect attendance.  During build, test and practice, sub teams meet several times a week.  Electrical and mechanical give support during practice.  Playing field does most of their work early on then start on the shipping container.  We take a skeleton group to our first regional.  The second is the Midwest regional held close by so all the team can come.  Then we take 30-35 students to the nationals.  Each of the sub teams is given a certain number that can go and it is up to the adults on the team to make recomendations.  The teachers have the final say based on a variety of factors like attendance, fund raising, participation and grades.  We try to get each of the subteams working closely with mentors and the students get a chance to see what it is like to work in a corporate environment.  Large teams do get uncontrolled at times, but the students do get a chance to experience things they would not have a chance to otherwise.


Joe,
A technique we used last year was to have a foot descend pnuematically when we wanted to turn.  The foot had a plastic or delrin surface that had little friction with the carpet.  This would lift one set of wheels off the ground and let the other two do the driving.  The side friction is not only killing your turns but your current skyrockets during the manuever as well.  That shortens your running time and drags down everything else on the robot that runs off the battery.  In the past (pre-backup battery) this would have reset the robot controller.




i agree.... we were having the same problem last year and probably this year too... that really helped us out...

another thing, think of different places that you can place pneumatics in of the robot which might help you to get up to the platform...  ;)

The logo's not too bad, but, not too great for print though i think. :]

Here's ours:

http://www.syntheticorange.com/wow/images/logo2.png
there are about 60 students on the roster for the team... in average about 30 shows up... build time 15 shows up... but still the students are involved with lot of other work on the team...
If you can find a place that the latex tubing will pull enough that it will extend the cyclinder when it is pointing down and using the non-pneumatic air extension you can make Ken's spring way work.  If not, route all exhaust from you cyclinder to a single solenoid with a stop on one of the output and block so you can control the stroke length of the cyclinder.  You look like you could have the cyclinder partially extended to begin with and a least cut down on the wait for it to lift.  Or you could lengthen your arm and purchase a shorter cyclinder.  A 16" would do the job or even a 12" or 8" and would reduce the air needed.  You lose height gained but an inch or 2 feet both get you 50 points.  The one just works faster.  I would add the second accumulator and make sure to reduce all tubing lengths.  PM me and I'll give you more info about the single solenoid.

When designing team logo's you want to remember at least one thing.

Make the color's easily printable in any media... Digital, paper, and don't forget T-Shirts..

In the past we have made our logo's mostly one or two colors to save money on printing costs, especially for T-Shirts!
hey buddy... you got 6 weeks 2 days now...  :p
how about another idea. i can't see exactly how well this'll fit, but how about starting with your cylinder half extended. (use the double w/t single solenoid) from the angle of your photo, it seems like you may be able to do this. maybe.
"hey we got two extra days to drill holes"
my exact words when learing about the 2 extra days
I dont believe we will have a problem with the wire size, since we are using 6 awg wire for all main power.  The Stinger Fuse Box (recommended on the Q&A) does do a little bit of distrobution, so if possible, i think im going to use it as a distributor: (ASCII ART)

These 3 are power ins(interconnected), we use 1 as an in from the breaker, and 1 as an out to the other fuse box
__|__
|+|+|   These 3 are outs, 2 to the motors, other is unused.

We did ground everything back to the mini fuse box, but as you guys say, we may use the stud.

I really dont want to waste a pound on something useless like that distro box unless it is absolutely needed, especially because our Stinger MAXI fuse box is rated for up to 4 awg wire.
I love it when an animation comes together.

I pity the fool who locks up a hard drive.

Please reread Al's post, the distribution block and ground stud are required for this years robots circuit.  If they werent going to help in the long run they wouldnt be required.
And make sure to keep a copy of the logo on file...or else you will end up having to scan your shirt in...right, Elgin? :D
Wow "Dez", you read my mind on that one!!


I was going to say that too....


With 4-wheel, tank-drive, as you are using, your robot must be wider than it is long, or you will have trouble turning. Make sure your robot is 36" wide and 30" long, not 30" wide and 36" long. This will make a huge difference in the ability of your robot to turn.




Actually, its the distances between wheels that matters (technically, it's the distance between the contact points of the wheels that matters).  Measure the distance between two wheels one side of the robot and call that *y* and measure the distance between two wheels on opposite sides of the robot, but both in the front (or back), and call that distance *x*.  If y &gt; x, your turning efficiency is drastically reduced.  If x &gt; y, you should be good.

To understand why, let's look at some physics.  Let's say your pivot point is the center location between all 4 wheels.  Then, the distance to each wheel is called *r*.  To find the torque used to turn the wheel you take the cross product between Force and Distance (both vectors).  Look at the atttached drawing.  The force that the ground exerts on the wheel (friction) is always parallel to the wheel.  Draw a line from the wheel's contact point to the center.  When the angle between force and this line is brought closer to 90 degrees, you can turn better.  (A cross product between vectors **A **and **B** is equal to* A*B*sin(d)* where *d* is the angle between the two vectors. So when d is closest to 90 degrees, sin (d) is closest to 1, so the cross product has its largest value.)

Moral: Move the left set of wheels farther from the right set of wheels.  And make the wheels on the left closer to each other, and the wheels on the right closer to each other.  Or don't use 4-wheel drive.  Our team made this *"mistake"* the first two years - we could hardly turn or maneuver.  This year we went with track drives and they turn on a dime...<br><br><a class='attachment' href='/uploads/default/original/3X/a/8/a87bc273eef71765453680637e86506a4fb56169.bmp'>4wheeltorque.bmp</a> (22.7 KB)<br><br><br><a class='attachment' href='/uploads/default/original/3X/a/8/a87bc273eef71765453680637e86506a4fb56169.bmp'>4wheeltorque.bmp</a> (22.7 KB)<br>

So.... why use maxscript when you could do most of this with Particle Flow system? Or am i missing something?




i agree with Lev, what is the special secret?  Or are you just trying out the max script?
This is a slight reitteration, but I'd ask the person who asked you this:

If we had 8 weeks, would you be asking that question with 8 instead of 6?

I don't think any amount of time would ever make me feel like I could create a multifunctioning robot that performs so many tasks in such a complicated way within such dimesions and weight.  If you sum up what you do in 6 weeks to someone, no matter how much of a geek they are - they will be impressed.

Best of luck to all....especially rookies!


To quote Woodie at the 2001 Kickoff: "Because we wanted to have mercy"

He went on to explain that no matter how much time they gave us, we would always want or need more. So they limit it to what they feel is the bare minimum to meet the challenge at all.




Yes, a similar quote at the 2000 Kick-off from Dean is below:

An angry mentor walked up to the Microphone during the 2000 Kick-off Q&A session and said, "How come you don't give us more time?! Why only six weeks?!"  To which Dean simply replied, "Because we like you!"
Everyone laughed. Funny because its true!!
i really like the logo from an artistic point of view... good colors, good design... but does it go with the team name!?!

the only thing you might want to change is the font, it was kinda hard to read
My ChiefDelphi signature randomly cycles through three of ours (you can refresh to see them) and my avatar is another one. The blue WR logo of my teammates' avatars is another. We got lotsa those. :)
Put in a freshly charged battery and then find out the following:

What is your OI reading for voltage when you are tring to turn?? You may be spiking out the system with using only two drill motors for 4 wheel drive?

If it is reading anything less than 6 or 7 Volts then I suggest you either redesign your tranny:ahh: or for goodness sakes, make some wheel adjustments like stated above!!
Holy mother of... great job, do you think it's sturdy enough?!

Yes.  The scouting data will be updated tommorrow.
your previous code with the bitwise AND (&) should work fine - just use the hex or decimal codes I posted above (because you AND it with the original constant, the lower bits don't matter, and thus it will be true for the entire range).

True, except you are dealing with two layers of interupts here.  The high priority interupt can interupt your low priority interupt.  And since we don't know exactly what IFI is doing with their code...

I'm learning a LOT about what doesn't work with this machine.
What are the yard bags for? :p


That looks like my fridge on a regular basis :D
I have had the same problem.  However, I dont believe the aliases are wrong but rather the LEDs are incorrect.  Red now means the M+ is at 12v (M- gnd) and Green means M- is at 12V (M+ gnd).  I say this beacause I am using a single solenoid which is spring return, so I only power M+, which the red wire of the solenoid is hooked up to.  I simply toggle that relay's fwd bit to operate the solenoid and it works.  I would not go changing the polarity of your compressor because reverse polarity could seriously damage it.


Because almost all potentiometers that will find will not revolve all the way around. Also pots wear out very easily when attached to a constantly rotating shaft. Last years controller was too slow for using an encoder. This years processor has no trouble keeping up with a 256 tick encoder. We have ours controlling our motors beautifully right now. Dead recoding is incredably precise with them. It's not a bias, it's just one is better than the other.


Ok, thanks.


i betcha the catalac engeneers had fun with that one. maybe you should let the kids do some work, eh?




I'm far too tired to deal with an issue that has been discussed on these forums far too many times.  Let me briefly sum things up.

1. Please don't make assumptions about the student to engineer contribution ratio on a given team.  Unless you're on the team or closely associated with them, you can't possibly know.

2. FIRST allows teams to set their own guidelines on how much engineer contribution takes place.  Just because your team may be more student driven doesn't mean that every team should be that way.  By all means take pride in your own team's setup, but don't knock other teams because they aren't like yours.

3. The 'I' in FIRST stands for inspiration.  That control box is definitely inspirational, no matter who it was built by.

4. Finally, there is no 't' in Cadillac.

Every year I'm impressed by Truck Town (and a little afraid).  Keep up the amazing work.


What are the yard bags for? :p


For throwing out bad idea's silly, left over from week 1!
Oh, and they are used again in week six to throw out all those pieces you drill out from your robot to save weight!! lol

Wow, I hope these company's are paying you for all this advertising!! lol

I like how you seperated the coke and Pepsi products though, nice touch...
And the cat in the hat helps you on your robot??? Do you have a wonderful Whatsamawhozit??

We have one of those too!! :rolleyes:


I came up with what I think is a very good option for strategy and game play, however the rest of my team decided it was not the best idea.  It involves making a net or basket about 8 feet wide that you can unfold and position under the ball dump in the autonomous mode.  If you had a reliable partner, they could knock off the 10 point ball, hopefully not too soon, and you would catch most of the balls if not all of the balls.  You could then have a way for them to be put back out in the corner near your ball corral, so they would not all be spread across the field and you would be able to easily push them into the corral as fast as your team could remove them probably.  If you could consistently do that you would most likely be chosen in the finals.  You may not automatically go to finals, because you may have one or more partners who cannot make it to the 10 point ball.  However, a team who could get to the ball easily and is in the position to pick alliance partners would love to be able to control the balls.  During STUbots (students act out game) we found that to be one of the best moves.  However, our team decided that we don't want to have to rely on the other robot to get to that ball.





Hmmmmmm, sounds like a good strategy to me!!! I wonder how many teams will do that?
Our bot did a stack overflow reset the other day when we were testing new autonomous code. This seems like what caused your problem.
Last year, our team made nametags instead, with little clip on the back.  It wasn't really that expensive, especially if you go to one of those places online that make free nametags, laminate them, then attach clips to the back  :D also, we had a few nametags with names of each person on the team, the engineers, and people who helped the group.
I agree on what everyone on this thread has said. 6 weeks is plenty, if not the perfect ammount of time to do what we all have to do. If we all had 8-9 weekls, we could make a lot more complicated machines. Is this good? Not necessarily. You'll notice that in most competitions, the people who seem to do the best, ahve the simplest designs. Complexed machines only add to possible break downs and fixing between competitions.

Not only that, but I believe that 5 weeks seems to be the stress point for a lot of teams. It seems like no matter who you are, after 5 weeks, you start argueing and stressing with everyone on your team. It's innevitable. You see the same people for hours on end, sparks are gonna tend to fly (sometimes literally, gotta love dremels  :D ).

To me, 6 weeks seems like the optimum ammount of time. It's known rookie teams feel like this is not a lot of time, but then again, they're rookies and we all get through it. As time goes on, you figure out ways to manage the 6 weeks more efficiently, and some teams might even be completed before the 6 weeks is up.
btw....at low speed it DOES provide MORE TORQUE!!!!! ......where is the power going hmmm???? not speed so....torque! (i think our mentor can explain it better because he knows the equations and stuff) that is just a simple way of putting it.
As in the real world, the people up top make the decisions. One of the hardest things about working is a deadline. Usually totally unrealistic and impossible to accomplish. Guess what, we still seem to make then. Managing priorities, working together and proper time management comes with experience. I think that this is a great learning tool for the future. Challenging yourself and your team to accomplish what they thought they couldn't.

I am not on a rookie team but last year was my first time building with a team. After a couple of weeks of talking and planning I realized we only had 4 weeks left. Things began to get done but by week 5 we had no transmission. Kick into overdrive and spend a few all nighters. Boy it's tough to go to work with an hours sleep knowing that tomorrow will be the same. We did get it done but no practice time. This year has been much better even though we are still not moving. Transmission built and tested and almost installed. We might even get some practice time.

As a mentor I am burnt out. Even 2 extra days seems like eternity. My family has not seen me for more than 20 minutes except for the 2 times I took my wife out for lunch (no time for supper). There is a great demand on time and I for 1 am glad for the end to approach. Going to 4 regionals and championship basically wipes out 3 1/2 months of the year.

Do I regret any time spent? NO !!!!!   This is the greatest program ever and I feel privileged to be part of it. An OLD say is " You can't get enough of a good thing." I don't believe this to be true. If we all get burnt out then we will just quit and move on. When April comes I feel that I wouldn't want to work on a robot again and by September 1 I am chomping at the bit to get going. It is good to keep the desire burning and I believe that FIRST has come up with a good compromise. All I ask is that they don't make build time shorter.
:ahh:

And yes, that's how I got the "Small Wonder" name...'cause business students just don't "get" robots (and also because I'm short).
USE QMAIL! I run Qmail and Courier-IMAP off of a BSD box (MacOSX is based off of BSD) in my home and it works great. I host mail for 8 domains off a DSL line.
We chopped up a PWM cable and wired it to the gray cable that was in the kit. Works fine.
The debate has been said many times.  The conclusion is:

Engineers shouldn't touch robots
Students shouldn't touch robots
Engineers should help out students
Students should help out the engineers

All are the True.  But who's truth's is the question.

This thread doesn't need to start this debate again.

As someone who has made their share of OI panels, I would like to congratulate you on your fine workmanship.  A couple questions:

Is it made out of Chrome and Diamond Plate?
How wide is it? (looks wider than any I've ever seen but that may be an optical illusion)
What are you using to power the blue LEDs?
Soooo many people using that tread material for their whatever. Not being on a team, I have yet to see this stuff up close. Can you give me a rundown on why this stuff is good?
is that 8 double selenoids i'm counting?  :ahh:
There are 40+ in our roster... Roughly 30 show up to work. The nice thing about having a larger team is that we have 5 people dedicated to graphics. 4 dedicated to marketing. 2 dedicated to electrical. 7 are leadership (though they also fall into those other categories.) The remainder of the people are builders, machinists, or odd-job doers.

Maybe this year is your year???

LOL, but that's what we all want though, right??  To win the Championships??

See you down in Atlanta hopefully!!

BTW, what's your weight in this picture??? It seems like it's awful close to 130lbs...  lol
I see lots o' goodies!!
Glad the code is of use to some teams. And sorry I didn't respond sooner. I actually went 24+ hours w/o reading email.

The "23" as a parameter will have caused a problem. That causes a pointer (address) to the string to be passed, not even close to what you want. And the first byte of the address was probably a zero, resulting in writing zero to that EE address.

Make sure to use
#include "eeprom.h"
which would have caught that mistake, since the compiler would have know that an unsigned char should be passed and you passed a pointer to char.

If you're going to write just one byte per 26 ms loop, you actually don't need to call processEEQueue, since writeEE itself calls it. Only if you call writeEE multiple times in quick succession (in a single loop) should you have to call processEEQueue. In your example, since you called writeEE in one loop then readEE in subsequent loops, except for the issue with "23" it should have worked.

btw....at low speed it DOES provide MORE TORQUE!!!!! ......where is the power going hmmm???? not speed so....torque! (i think our mentor can explain it better because he knows the equations and stuff) that is just a simple way of putting it.



at first glance, that is what i thought as well, but when you really think about it, it doesn't (at least not in the config. that i've seen). the planetary gear system is not really a CVT, because it relies on the differences in motor speed, instead of varying the gear ratios. you are assuming that a constant amount of power is going to be going into the system, and if this where true, then you really would get more torque at lower speeds, and vice versa. but since you slow one of the motors down to slow the output speed of gear system, then the amount of power going into the system is decreased.
but as matt adams wrote, you can get the same amount of torque at varying speeds, which is a major advantage. less power needed to achieve desired force=less current draw=less likely to trip a breaker
cool robot...i like ur wheels they look pretty cool, ..your big ball grabber looks a lot like Team 60s ..... great minds think alike

hold up..... i jus read the below post...u guys are working together......thats cool i guess



if you are talking about the relay spikes that are in the KOP - you cannot use those to control the brake pins - the spikes put out 12V switched plus or minus, and they need power on their input (+12V) to work.  they dont get their power from the PWM cables.




Yes. Wiring a Spike to the brake/coast jumper on a Victor would probably cause an unwanted release of magic smoke. If you intend to use something to control the jumpers for the Victors that drive your robot, then you'd probably be switching both at the same time and would only need one servo. Controlling the braking mode of your speed controllers with a servo and a pair of microswitches is a lot cheaper than destroying them by feeding 12 volts to the I/O lines of the speed controllers' logic circuitry.
we lower the speed of the motors at close to equal rates...so they are going almost the same speeds (although not always the same direction)
what i mean is that we aren't lowering one of the motors to achieve a slower speed we are lowering both of them...(that is simply lowring power in to each one...) the motors should really never be at different speeds relative to each other
I'm not sure if it's the same as last year, but the judges made up re-wire out pressure switch to the digital outputs before we could participate.

if you are lowering the speed of both motors, then you will also be lowering the torque coming out of both motors, because to lower the speed, you have to lower the power going into them.
Nice job guys
Must have finally got your PIC gears
Like to see the rest


Wow.  I'm in a bit of a state of shock.  I've heard rumours that team 60 and team 254 were going to collaborate, but I didn't expect this.

http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=6123&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose

The robots look virtually identical to me. (aside from the fact that one is more complete than the other)

Having two teams of the quality and pedigree of 60 and 254 working together to build the same robot.  Wow.  All I can say is lookout.

I have so many more questions, but I'll start with how much collaboration was there?

Great job guys.  Amazing.




Our team and Team 60 have worked very closely, starting with hours on the phone and numerous emails between the teams during the design phase of this season. Each team built essentially half of the robots, with 60 machining the upper subframe and arm assembly, and 254 handling the lower frame, wheels, and programming.

Therefore, may the "rumor" be confirmed.  :D

Also, I'd be happy to answer any other questions about the partnership, our robots, or anything else.
Very true, since you're new to it, you'll find qmail or exim much easier to setup/manage.


-Randy
Why same robots? why did you guys design two of the same robots? What is the benifits of that?
Our team's been around since '95 or '94, I forget right now, but our managemtn structure has evolved pretty well.

Right now I'm Dillard High's Student Team Leader. We have two schools invovled in the team, Dillard and Taravella.

From Team Leader, we branch down into subdivisions of:
-Electrical
-Mechanical
-Software
-Animation
-Graphics
-Marketing / PR

Each subdivision has a Manager and a Co-Manager. They share the responsbilities of running each subdivision. It works pretty well usually.
(Especially when you've got somewhere around 60-80 students on the team).
Ohhhh, I never thought of putting a wrench in a drivetrain. I bet it gives you more torque  :D
Whew, ok, lots of questions to answer:

Jessica - We've been using the waffle tread material since 2002, and it's worked out great. The stuff's pretty easy to find (it's actually conveyor belt material you can order from McMaster), and it provides good traction on almost any surface.

pras - There are only 2 double solenoids. The other 6 are singles.

Elgin - Haha, thanks for the props. We weighed the complete robot last night, and it was exactly 129 pounds...it doesn't leave too much weight for powdercoating, which we think will add about 2 pounds. Looks like we might have to resort to desperate measures like cutting off a couple cm off each bolt or cheese-holing everything  :D
Haha, thanks for the laugh. Looks like someone has nothing to do tonight  :)
If you're using 8 solenoids, I'm guessing you're gonna be going for multi-positioning with the pneumatics this year?
Hahahaha. very, very amusing. We could use more stuff like this on the forums methinks.


Ohhhh, I never thought of putting a wrench in a drivetrain. I bet it gives you more torque  :D




Yep, we learned today that wrenchs are for drivetrains, screwdrivers for arms.
By doing so, we were able to form an alliance That was never before seen.

We essentially became two teams in one.

And as one team, if either of us becomes successful, we will both feel proud for an accomplishment that we did TOGETHER.

FIRST isn't only about the robots.  It's about building relationships, partnerships, and people.

I forget, do servos requre spikes? 'cause that would just be lovely in a painful sort of way.

No. They are powered by the Robot Controller and accept a signal directly from a PWM port.

Please...the chemicals would create some dangerous reactions.

Use magnesium.
I browse the forums late at night almost all the time (just look at some of my post times, especially close to ship) and lots of odd things are posted then, but this has got to be the craziest, sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled post I have ever seen. Unfortunately, your day’s work is not done until you wire that last Victor speed controller (nope that wasn't a hallucination :D ).  Finally, I leave you with these words of advice:

Don't Drink and Scoot, especially on an Overclocked Segway!  :ahh: Just give up those Segway keys (well maybe you can keep the black one. I mean ... how much damage could you do in beginner mode? :yikes:  )
Our plan is simple.

Simple, but effective.

We used neural nets to train our system to the point of unbeleivable accuracy, so we're sure this will work.

First, the robot will use a couple scanners to locate the balls, and a CCD system combined with [Sherlock](http://www.goipd.com/Products/Sherlock/) will locate the judge.

Next, the death laser shall stem forth in a *glorious* green light, and eliminate any judges.

With lack of judging, we should easily be declared the winner of our match. Especially if we point to the laser.

That photo was taken several weeks ago. The fourth Victor is a spare and has since been removed from the board.

> how much damage could you do in beginner mode?


well, the cat certainly moved before.


We have a couple of nifty label makers. :)




Where you hiding them?!?
Thermite adds an interesting chemichal component that will amuse your ChemEng people to no end (and the officials, as it burns through your robot, the carpet, the field supports, the concrete floor, and the bedrock beneith.


A small research team from CEU (College of Eastern Utah) is going down to the Arizona Regional as part of the process to figure out if we can get a team going out here in the middle of the black hole for FIRST teams.




Our rookies get on our team email during build season. In addition our mentors are on call at the shop, on cell, and at home during build season. We don't have to be your mentor to have all that happen for you WHEN you get a team going. Feel free to lean on us as part of your support team.
Our team is structured kind of like a pyramid:

It goes from The advisors to the captains, to the committee leaders, to the rest of the team.
We leave the candidates in alone in a room, with a 1.75 liter jug of cheap vodka. Last man standing gets the job.

Yeah, I'm still concerned about the power draw on the battery because of the laser. 20 Amp-hours dosn't seem like quite enough, and that cold fusion power design I was working on this afternoon didn't seem to quite be up to what I would call "working". On the upside, I did find a cure for cancer. I think the judges wouldn't notice if we added 2 more batteries, especially if they were dodging the laser/vaporized.
The students here at CEU do that every day as part of the music program in the MIDI lab. It's a requirement of the degree program to have a working knowledge of sound sample technology along with the physics of sound. It's pretty cool.
Sampling is very nice and saves a lot of money. We're using the lab now to sequence a sample CD along with some tracks of live singers for Senator Orrin Hatch to practice with to narrate a big project of ours for the DAR that we'll be doing at Constitution Hall in Washington D.C. next fall for the 9-11 commemoration. Cool stuff!
Pulling stuff off the web is definetely an alternative for the starving musician. I've pulled a few things off lately to do some sequencing on some of my own outside projects.
Technically our team has 33 members - but that's only technically. I think there are approx. 8 on animation, 6 on PR, and the rest on Build. 4 of us overlap (me, Eric C., Vincent, and David) overlap on more than one group. In Build, only maybe 7 - 10 at max actually "work" - I know that there are a couple of team members that have never done anything at all.

In our first year, we had less people - and almost everybody worked, which was really nice. Now in our third year, most of us that come regularly and work are those same ones how joined at the birth of the club. We also know each other really well (inside and outside of the club), which lets us work really well in the team. However, it does make us sort of defensive to new members. (I'm guilty of this too.) In spite of that, anybody who works hard and will give anything (time, effort, etc.) for the team is always accepted, no matter how big the group becomes.

One of the problems with such a small "core" group of members is that most of us will graduate next year (one of the core graduates this year).  Some of the new members are fusing into the core, but after next year I really don't what's gonna happen...


Where can we buy new IR sensors? All of ours seem to have magically broken over night in a way reminiscent of Titanic.


From the [FAQ](http://kevin.org/frc/faq.html):

**Q: I can't find the TSOP34840 sensor in stock anywhere. Is there an alternative device?**
A: Yes, use the virtually identical [Vishay TSOP4840](http://kevin.org/frc/TSOP4840.pdf), which is available at [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/index.cfm?handler=displayproduct&lstdispproductid=282288&e_categoryid=91&e_pcodeid=78202) and [Newark](http://www.newark.com/NewarkWebCommerce/newark/en_US/support/catalog/productDetail.jsp?id=33C1857) (where for some strange reason it's incorrectly listed as a resistor).

I am in heavy deliberation at the moment. I am trying to decide whether or not I wish to use a potentiometer or encoder for something relating to the subject of this thread. I am pretty much at a loss for good reasons (I have never used potentiometers or encoders before), so I am wondering why you have a bias that steers more towards an encoder than to a potentiometer.


As Dylan and others have pointed out, potentiometers have problems when used for positioning/control. Encoders, on the other hand, are designed for this type of application. You can find some example encoder code [here](http://kevin.org/frc).

Alright, now it’s out. Team 254 and Team 60 collaborated this year to build almost identical robots. Since the questions have already started and I’m sure many are to follow I will attempt to sort everything out now.

Our teams’ friendship started back in the 2000 season when Kingman (team 60) earned the number one seed at the Silicon Valley Regional and they picked us as their ally. Our alliance went on to win the regional and over the next few years we wound up winning several events together. Sometimes they seeded and picked us, other times we picked them. As a result of our teams’ successes as well as the time spent together, our respect for each other and our friendship has grown over the years to say the least.

I guess the official collaboration thing really began back in 2001 when, during the first few weeks of the build cycle, we basically shared nothing more than our opinions regarding how we felt the game would play out that year. Our two teams went on to win the Silicon Valley regional together for the second straight year, and we (254) ended up finishing second at Nationals while Kingman finished third, both of us being knocked out by team 71, Beatty (Awesome robot).

When the 2002 game was announced it was readily apparent that traction was of a huge concern that year and we once again discussed strategy with Kingman who helped us out by giving us a lead on some incredible tread for our wheels. We went on to win a third straight regional together and this time it was Kingman’s turn to place second at Nationals while we were knocked out during the divisional playoffs.

OK, so now it’s 2003 and we have gotten to be pretty good friends. This year we shared not only our strategy, but our entire design. We would point out flaws in their design and they would point out the flaws in ours (Any one notice that we both had feet to grip the mesh last year?). Again we both had success in the regionals and each other to thank.

Well anyway after the 2003 season we decided to collaborate on building a new drive train (inspired by team 25) which we entered in the Cal Games under the name “Bionic Poofs” (Bionic Bulldogs + Cheesy Poofs) it was wicked fast and we found that working with a team from another state wasn’t as hard as it sounds. We shipped the robot back and forth and emailed the programming with no problems whatsoever.

Since we had designed it together we began this season with the intension of sharing the production load and building our drive trains together.  Once again we began talking about the “how would I beat you, how would you beat me” thing and realized that neither one of us knew how this game would pan out. Eventually (actually were still refining things) we came up with what we felt was a very adaptable design which could be competitive regardless of how the game pans out and we ran with it.

Cut to the chase and basically what you will see this year from teams 254 and 60 is a design that is compilation of the ideas that were put forth by the students and engineers from both of our teams. In “the real world” when companies are faced with large tasks they seldom act alone, they work together alongside other companies which compliment their own attributes. This year our two teams felt that we could build a better product together than either one of us could have built alone, so that is exactly what we did.

Will we continue to work together in the future?
Of course, we are friends and we like and respect each other.

Will we work together on a level of this magnitude?
Who knows, this is uncharted territory for FIRST (at least as far as I know). What I do know is that the kids involved with both teams have had a chance to see what it’s like to work on a project in a real world setting. We both had different strategies coming into this and we have both had to compromise along the way in order to accommodate the needs of the other team.

To quote Amanda M (Team 60) “FIRST isn't only about the robots. It's about building relationships, partnerships, and people.”  Amanda if you came up with that on your own you are intelligent beyond your years, because that is exactly what FIRST is about and I believe that that goal is much easier accomplished together than it is alone.

The steps we have taken towards building a unified team (and isn’t that what FIRST should really be considered?) will hopefully be followed by others, this type of  sharing of information can only serve to enlighten everyone.

Who knows what the future will bring, right now we have the Cheesy Poofs and the Bionic Bulldogs working in unison. Will the world of FIRST one day see the Bionic Poofs? I hear there have been sightings on the West coast, who knows what’s to follow.
somehow... it seems like cheating to me

i guess it's for the best

but honestly the first thing i thought was "that's cheap..."

Thanks....thats me sleeping on the table. I guess the late night are cool if you have a plan. Otherwise, you will just sit around and do a lot of nothing.
this is somewhat off topic

but how exactly are teams mounting the lights?

I glanced at them tonight, and i didn't see any easy way to attach them?

should we just epoxy them or did i miss some kind of mounting hole?
awesome!

That was a great detailed answer to my small question. Well i perosnally i have seen both poofs and kingman work together and alone in the competition. Their Bionic Poofd robot at calgames was great this last year. I think 254 and 60 should have a great success story for current and future teams in FIRST. I like how the teams are flushing their ideas back and forth and relating which is the optimal strategy for the game. also pouring in the ideas and also feedback on each others design to create a well balanced preforming robot. I cannot wait to see them preform this year. and who knows they might work as partners this year. that will create history!
this is crazy and i am already loveing it:)

yea lets hear a little more about the beafy pnumatics this year you guys are using along with 60? Also i am curious about your drive train!
Ok, thank you all for your help.
I want to congratulate not just on your fine work on this year's robot, but also your courage to leap to a newer level not many people in FIRST have thought of.  It is easy to talk about an idea, I've done it many times, including the idea of 2 teams working together to create a pair of robots that compliment each other in the competition of alliances.  But to implement the idea, to make it happen, against all possible opposition from people who might consider this unfair or even "cheating", that takes true courage, and dedication to the purpose of your program.

Those who know these two team will agree with me, they are 2 of the most successful teams in FIRST who did very well at competition, and most important of all, made a difference on their students.  This collaboration effort only tells me they want to be more successful than ever, and in my opinion, did exactly that.  The message I see from this isn't "look at us, we are better than you".  Instead, I see "we understand that we can learn from each other and put both teams' experience to create a better program for our students."  Just look at what Amanda M said in her message.  I would not believe the same thing would've been said from a student few years ago.

I still remember a time when FIRST was about "you or me".  Students on my old team used to look down on rivalry teams and vice-versa.  We used to have really bad attitudes against others who were successful in the competition.  But things changed when alliance first got introduced, then even more so at 2001 with the game of 4 teams on an alliance, and finally when organizations like WRRF, SCRRF, IndianaFIRST got started.  Now its about "you and me", and the idea that effort of a group benefit each team much more than efforts of individuals fighting against each other, with the ultimate purpose of inspiring and educating the students about science and technology.

This collaboration effort is a perfect example of how much FIRST have grown.  Instead of doing the same thing all the time, these two teams always strive to better themselves every yeah, and break new grounds for others to follow.  That is truly inspiring.  I cannot wait to see how this is going to turn out.  If anything, this got me thinking about a FIRST I never imagined could be possible.

Great job!  Hats off to Team 60 and 254 for something new to this program.  Like most new things, there will be criticisms as well as agreements.  But it only means you are getting people to start doing their own thinking.


where do you get these free relays from?

I will take 10 million please :c)

if you are talking about the relay spikes that are in the KOP - you cannot use those to control the brake pins - the spikes put out 12V switched plus or minus, and they need power on their input (+12V) to work.  they dont get their power from the PWM cables.




:ahh:  :ahh: i wouldent use a spike unless you wanted to ensure there was some rostin electronics! you can pick up a 5v relay at radioshack for 3.99... or if you wana get realy fancy check out digikey for a huge selection
We are in contact with the Director of the Regional and will be seeking permission to have a tailgate party in the parking lot...  Stand by for more details!
Where'd you get the Jolt?

They never have any at Wal-Mart.
Team 1382 has 26 students and about 10 mentors (engineers, teachers, & school staff). All students show up on a regular basis (daily) although some of them stay longer than others and most show up on saturdays and sundays...But there are days when there´s not much work and about 15-20 people are actually doing something useful...(the other members are there, however, they will usually be playing tetris or pinball :yikes: )

I think around 30 people overall on a team is a good number to have because the work is well-distributed & it´s not as difficult to communicate w/each other.. Team 1382 is split up into 5 groups:
6 students - marketing/public relations
3 st. - autodesk inventor
4 st. - 3d animation
6 st. - mechanics
7 st. - electronics & programming
Post the code that is causing problems. If we can look at it, we may be able to help. Also, tell us what it is supposed to do and what it seems to be doing instead.

Until then, here are my suggestions: ;)
1. Make sure you have a robot.
2. Make sure the robot has motors.
3. Make sure the RC is attched to the motors.
4. Make sure the wheels on the robot touch the ground.
5. Make sure you know assembler; it's so much better than C. (Bah! High level language. ;))
Last year, although we were not completly student run, but we had many of the same issues.  Our robots drivetrain barely worked, none of the sub-systems were fully operational, our autonomous mode never worked properly, we didn't even have it working when we shipped it.  Our robot SUCKED.

That was without a doubt the best year I have ever had with FIRST.

Even though our robot didn't work properly and no one else saw the true work of art that he was, we were all proud of our EARL(name of robot).  Many people may argue that a true FIRST team should have more mentor involvment, and I agree with that.  But this year and two years ago just aren't the same as last year.  Our team is not as close as it was.  We have been unable to recreate the type of team we had.  Now some people on my team may disagree with me, but I felt more inspired and much more like a team last year.  My first year on the team, we won nationals, and I can assure you that the feeling of winning as a divided team is much less rewarding then losing together.

So, my advice to you is this: Don't stress yourself more then you need to.  Try to enjoy what your team has to offer.  When you get to your first regional, use your robot as an excuse to interact with other teams.  Get help wherever it's needed.  I know how depressing it is when your robot doesn't work.  But I also know that the true spirit of FIRST exists in your team, not your robot.


Might you ship with your subsititute and then put the real stud in at your first regional?  This way, your robot can be approved by FIRST during practice day and you have a fully functional 'bot.

Hope you get your parts soon!



Any thing is OK as long as it is correct by the time your are inspected.  Don't forget that the stud is 3/8" so the terminals must be large enough to fit it when you change.


I dont believe we will have a problem with the wire size, since we are using 6 awg wire for all main power.  The Stinger Fuse Box (recommended on the Q&A) does do a little bit of distrobution, so if possible, i think im going to use it as a distributor:




Erich,
I know you don't want to hear this but the suggested replacement is a SFB1MAXPT which is a single maxi block. (See Team update #9 page 3) The one you describe which has a common input and three or four outputs is not allowed.  Sorry, I questioned FIRST on this last week.  The original four independent fuse holders on a single block or four single blocks are the only allowable parts. The SFB1MAXPT snaps together to form larger blocks.
BTW see my post about terminating #6 & #10 wires into these blocks here in the electrical forum.  They are designed for #4 - #8 wire but only grab about half of a #6 and about a 1/4 of #10 strands.  If you use super flexible wire, then even less of the strands are captured.


Is it made out of Chrome and Diamond Plate?
How wide is it? (looks wider than any I've ever seen but that may be an optical illusion)
What are you using to power the blue LEDs?




And allow me to clear a few things up. Thanks for the support all, this *was* built by students. Three of us, to be exact. Our Job, chassis, is done, so we decided to do a little something extra.

As for the Cadillac emblems, yes they are readily available. Brendan, Mike, and I went our and shaved a couple of escalades. GM rips these (and many many others) trucks apart, re-designs, and throws most of it away. So, we can basically take whatever we need to make the robot look really cool. If it is in the scrap bins.

As for the specifics on the board, the dimensions are as follows: 48”x9”x2.5”. It is made out of two plates of 1/8” aluminum, and supports of 1” stock T6 square tubing. The side panels are, in fact, diamond-plate aluminum. The grill is round aluminum stock. There’s no chrome.

As for the blue neons and LED bars, they are powered by a bosch battery pack (a drill housing).

I thank everyone, once again, for their comments and support. Can’t wait to see what everyone has come up with!
The ventures systems last year was baddddddd.  Just another reason to be online for hours! :yikes:
The robot isn't the whole purpose of the competition.  Just getting far enough along that you have somthing built is a major accomplishment as itself.  Sure, its fun to go to the competition and see how your mad building skillz stack up against other teams, but thats not the whole point of the competition.  Have fun this year just "learning the ropes" of the competition and how it works, and co0me in next season better knowing and better prepared to compete.  Hope to see you at nationals next year!!
Hmmmm.....
Our team tried this last year, we had a set of pedals that acted like "brakes"
The way they worked was they overrided every signal and  applied electronic brakes. That way, if we needed to stop, even if the joysticks were pushed all the way down, we could hit the brakes and the robot would come to a stop.
I built a relay box, that had four SPDT relays in it that were controlled simultaneously by a SPIKE.
As far a leagality is concerned... We asked the Q&A and got an ambiguous answer... I will see if I can find the exact response. If time permits we plan on doing the same this year. But instead of four realays we have one 4PDT relay we will use.

Good luck!
-Andy
the solonoids are not polarity sensitive - if current flows through the two wires they will trip

and I would be really surprized if the compressor cares which way it runs - the motor makes the piston go up and down - I dont think it cares if it goes down and up instead.
I think the collaboration thing is cool...But I don't like that you made identical robots and shared the work between the two teams...One of that robot scares me and you guys have just doubled my nightmares.
I got to the point where I was here practically all the time, refreshing every few minutes, just to catch anything new.  Then I realized I was spending all my free time (and some time I was supposed to be spending on work) on CD.  I was staying up 2 or 3 hours later than I wanted to, because distractions would keep me away from homework and studying.  So, I guess you could say I was an addict, but I'm recovering.


We were upgraded last week to the newest version of vBulletirn.

And yes, there is a hack to measure how much time people spend on the site.
I'm not sure if I will be installing that or not.



If I were choosing...I'd rather not know.

I don't need to know how much time I waste on the site; I know it's more than I should and that's **all** that I need to know.   :)


What are the yard bags for? :p




Why, for collecting all the empty bottles and turning them in for money to buy MORE caffeine!  Silly Indianers with no bottle deposit :p
i think a good measurement would be how much time I'm **not** on the site


zip ties.


Zipties will fix just about everything.

( as a replacement for the illegal ducttape )



We were showing off last year's (tri-wheel) robot during a Lego League event.  At the end of the day, we lost a bolt and our front wheel literally fell off.  Making things worse, we couldn't find the bolt.  We were able to fix the problem before we left, though...

Since then, the wheel has only been attached to the robot by wires...and zip ties.  Lots and lots of zip ties.   :D
This is the first year that 818 has chosen student leaders for the subteams.

The titles mean almost nothing, though.  The engineers and teachers are still the people who keep everything running.

So how did you do it Jeff?  Did you seek professional help?  Is there a 12 step program or did you just go cold turkey?


I've been limited but I can edit.  Even better would be a program that keeps track of the clicks or hits of each user so you could see who is the most active.


Hello All,
.......  All teams must use the ground stud. ..




Al,

I have read the rules back and forth. R42 references the wiring diagram, no requirement stated.  R44 states 6 AWG to all fuse panels.  I could not find the requirement to use the grounding stud in the Q&A either.

Is this required and where is this stated?  I have run between the fuse panels with #6 ground  wire and to the distro block.

Andy,
Bad news...Last year and this year are not very much different in use of the custom circuit board....
5.2.8 Custom Circuit Rules
&lt;R50&gt; The use of additional electronics is intended to allow teams to construct custom circuits for their robots.
The custom circuits may be used to indirectly affect the robot outputs, by providing enhanced sensorfeedback to the Robot Controller to allow it to more effectively decide how to control the robot. The custom circuits must draw power from a 20A circuit breaker. Smaller value fuses may be incorporated into the custom circuits for additional protection.  All outputs from the custom circuits must be connected to the analog inputs,digital I/O, TTL Serial Port, or Program Port on the Robot Controller.

The way I read that, a custom circuit may not talk to a speed controller.  If I were to inspect your robot last year, I would have had to rule against you.  Sorry.
The same rule applies for the use of relays that are driven by spikes.  The answer in a nutshell is "NO".
I agree that FIRST is intended to help spread and increase engineering knowledge, but the idea of two established teams sharing an identical design seems to have skewed the concept.  I feel personally that FIRST should be about each individual team sharing the work load and the joys and the pains that come along with engineering and manufacturing its own unique design.  While the idea of developing partnerships and friendships among colleagues and potential opponents is novel and advantageous, I feel that the fabrication, design, and communication that occurs as a single team creates and competes with its own robot cannot and should not be replaced.
Hmm... Really interesting...
Sounds fun! I wish more schools had a program like that.
I think I've got the links to the samples renewed, here they are:

Andy,
Your absolutely right, but reread the rule again.

&lt;R42&gt; Electrical devices "MAY ONLY" be wired as indicated in this section. For your convenience, reference the 2004 Robot Power Distribution Diagram.

I read that (and FIRST intreprets that) as the Power Distro Diagram is your bible.  You may only wire your robot as indicated.  As I stated before, if you have no need for the maxi fuse block then you can leave the distro and the fuse block out.  I can't imagine any team would give up the drills or the Chalupas but it is possible.  This is a safety issue as much as anything.  I can tell you from experience, there was a lot of scary wiring jobs last year.


For all of you who went to the UTC NE regional last year or were in the gallileo division at nat's... Team 195 has come to a stopping point. In our discussions about gripping methods/techniques, we came across the idea of bringing back our orange hands from last year's bot. Do you people think that would be an uber-cool idea, or just a waste of time?

[Pic for those of you with no idea...](http://www.pbase.com/image/12932326)
[And another...](http://www.pbase.com/image/12932308)





I don't know how effective they were, but they sure looked cool.
hmm as i look at the wiring diagram.. is it legal to wire the SPIKEs up with that cabling? it seems to me as if you need to use the 10 gauge monsters they give us.

(not trying to criticize, but i actually had the same question myself. It doesnt seem logical to wire a 10 gauge wire to a 16 gauge wire on the motor...)
Any other alternate uses for tools?   :cool:  :rolleyes:


I agree that FIRST is intended to help spread and increase engineering knowledge, but the idea of two established teams sharing an identical design seems to have skewed the concept.  I feel personally that FIRST should be about each individual team sharing the work load and the joys and the pains that come along with engineering and manufacturing its own unique design.  While the idea of developing partnerships and friendships among colleagues and potential opponents is novel and advantageous, I feel that the fabrication, design, and communication that occurs as a single team creates and competes with its own robot cannot and should not be replaced.





I some what disagree but then again it is all about perspective...if you are a single team and work with a few mentors to build a robot that is considered a fine course of action in FIRST, and when I see this great partnership between two teams I think of it as they are mentoring each other.  About building components for each other I also think this is fine.  Knowing that at most of the regional I have been to at some point I am working on a robot that isn't mine, and if you team has ever gotten things machined or welded at another company, I believe that all of these examples follow what these two teams are doing.  I think that this is a wonderful collaboration of minds and look forward to what they will produce in the future.
the idea of collaborating in order to design a build a robot together in my oppinion goes along with exactly what the FIRST competition is all about. FIRSt isn't about making a robot over 6 weeks, it's not about competing against other teams, though the aredaline is awesome and the comradere built is even better, but a major component about FIRST is gracious professionalism. In my oppinion, this kind of allianceship is a wonderful thing towards fullfilling the ideals of FIRST. Kudos to Teams 60 and 254
Where's the CODE RED mountain dew??? ;)
is it different? yes.  but is it cheating? no, I think its perfectly acceptable.  If the friendship between two teams allows them to build a better robot through a partnership that lets everyone play to their strengths, then that is exactly the kind of interaction that FIRST should encourage.  the two teams are still building the parts for two robots, just in a more specialized way.  as has been said, this IS the way that things happen in real life, and I don't think that it should be disallowed out of some antiquated need to preserve competition.  My team has a long-standing friendship with Rage (173), and although we don't go to the extent of building the robot together, I understand the benefits of a close friendship between teams and believe that under no circumstances should it be discouraged.


For throwing out bad idea's silly, left over from week 1!
Oh, and they are used again in week six to throw out all those pieces you drill out from your robot to save weight!! lol





Oh...I figured they were for throwing out annoying little HS freshman and rookies ;)
Congratulations on pioneering an amazing new way of approaching our competition.  I have a feeling that a few years from now your two teams will be the answer to a FIRST trivia question.  "Which two teams were the first to build the same robot?"  Next year I'm sure many other teams will follow suit.

Does this rule mean that the two teams have to charge each other standard hourly machining rates for the parts each made for the other?  What about accounting for non-team member design, programming, assembly time?  If I'm reading the rules correctly, that's the case.

Thoughts?
Also on mounting- Can we cover up a corner  (or two) of the led's for mounting?
Pat--"How many times am I gonna hit my head on that stupid arm???"
Jake--"As many times as it takes."
I am still thinking it over, but my first impression is that generally I don't  like it.  I know there are some "real world" parallels, but I don't think they really are that close of a comparison.

I know that Team Ford has made some steps toward collaboration and coordination of chassis.  I suppose other have done similar things to one extent or another.

Here is the nub of my concern:  What would people think of all 16 Delphi teams having the machine that the Chief Delphi Team is making this year (or the Delphi Knights, or the TechnoKats, or whatever)?

CEO's love to have winning teams.  We all (including CEO's) know that there is a huge luck factor in winning the Championship.  Having 16 chances to win is better than having just one.

I worry that the pressure to win may increase if this type of collaboration becomes more common -- up to this point, we have always been able to say that TOO close of coordination was out of the bounds of fairness... ...but perhaps not.

Beyond this, I am not sure that it is good for FIRST to have 16 Chief Delphi robots out in the wild ;-)

It could be a strange new world we are entering.

whoa... a t-shirt teaser. haha thats the first of seen of one of those
Our official logo is the first one, with the North Brunswick Township High School mascot clutching a gear in its talons. The second one, the one we've been using lately, is our 2000 robot, Cradle Robber, holding a Bristol-Myers Squibb (our sponsor) logo. Which do you like better?


Mike,
Sorry to sound so strong in the reply but safety is a big issue for us.  If I missed the smiley (and I rarely look at the graphics) I thought some other teams might think it was OK to do.  You can't believe what I have seen other teams do as far as electrical goes.  FIRST also has intervened and that is why the strict new rules and electrical parts this year, in my opinion.





Yeah, I agree with this being my 5th year in FIRST I have helped fix my share of troublesome wiring. I think the new rules will help simplify inspecting the robots. Only disadvantage i can see is running a thicker wire up an arm or similar. Oh well, still for the better, kudos to FIRST.
hey i am a new team and i am i a great need is there a code for the stupid banner sensore some  plz help

So, to kick it off, here are a few pictures I've taken:

The first comes from my summer trip out West.  I saw the sign for Interstate 229, outside of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and took a picture for everyone's favorite 229er, JVN.

http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~waegelin/229sign.jpg

The second comes from IRI 2003.  A few of us went around the Omni Hotel, looking for Room 201, and took a picture.

http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~waegelin/Room_201.JPG

Finally, going along with the theme of picture #1, I took a picture of Interstate 696, here in the Detroit area.

http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~waegelin/696sign.jpg
CD is my homepage.  ... so most of the time when I go looking for something, I end up clicking a link from the portal, and forgetting whatever it was that I needed to get done.  Figures.

I'd be scared to see how much time I'm here.  Very, Very Scared.
yeah...during one of the practice rounds at the chesapeake regionals, a bot caught on fire, cause being bad wiring ;)


I know it was in the first version posted, and its also in the current version (2-10-2004). I haven't used any intermediate versions, but I find it hard to beleive that Innovation FIRST would have dropped it.

Lines 211 and 212 (in Default_Routine)
pwm01 = p1_y;
pwm02 = p2_y;




I looked right past the obvious!:o
I believe at one time (maybe EDU code) they had the line:


/*---------- 2 Joystick Drive ----------------------------------------------

*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/



and that's what I was missing.

Thanks!
I wonder if they would replace it if available.  They do have a rule that if large balls leave the field, they will be placed back in play.  Not exactly the same thing, but in general they both describe losing a large ball from play.
Seems like their intent is to keep 3 large balls in play as much as possible.
Maybe a question for Q/A system if it's not been asked already.
Our team works off a very simple system.  There are the first year members and  then there's everyone else.  First year members usually don't know much about FIRST so its hard for them to become team leaders(although we always have one or two who move to that position very quickly).  For the second year members, it's never actually decided who the leaders are.  Everyone is able to figure out who to turn to for a leader.  Of coarse, we only have about 14 people this year so everyone knows everyone else pretty well.

I'm also worry about the possibility of referees DQing the team that pops the large balls.
I don't remember what the rules was in 2001 game which had the big balls also. Because of the intense game this year, I predict a lot of damage balls- small and large.

:ahh:
I am not a FIRST official, but I have plenty of FIRST experience.

If history is used, here is how I expect FIRST to rule this:

1)  The big ball will NOT be replaced during the match.  They will most likely still count it as a playing object (good luck manipulating it, though).

2)  Your team will get a warning from the head ref and they will force you to correct the problem that caused the ball to be popped.

3)  If your robot pops another ball (in a later match), you will be DQed and not allowed to compete again until you can demonstrate that you will no longer pop balls.

This is how they handled this situation in the past, so I guess I would expect it to be the same this year.  I would ask the question on the Q&A forum, just to be sure.


An angry mentor walked up to the Microphone during the 2000 Kick-off Q&A session and said, "How come you don't give us more time?! Why only six weeks?!"  To which Dean simply replied, "Because we like you!"





Thank God again!
If you install it, you might find me online 20/24 hours a day :ahh:
Personally, I think it looks like The Cheat. With spots. :D
Section 5.6.1
"Except as noted herein, each Ground (GND or Common (-) wire from a speed controller, relay, or Robot Controller must go directly from that item to one of the 12 Common (-) terminal tabs on the circuit breaker/fuse blocks."

I hope this helps.  This will be what the inspectors will be looking for.

Andy, you have us all dumbfounded... care to give us any hints?? :confused:
1. We are using three banners arranged so that two will be on when leaving the line.

2. We haven't tested line following yet. Hopefully we'll get a chance tonight, our drive trains been having issues.


You're misunderstanding my statement. I didn't say it was machined badly, I'm saying a team like that could of machined it BETTER. I'm talking mainly about the edges, personally if it was me, I would of made it more of a straight edge as opposed to being bumpy such as theres. I'm not sure if it's meant to be like that, but seeing as how big the tires are, and what they're trying to do, I'm just offering my opinion.




It lookes to me like the "bumps" are to provide what we here in the aircraft biz call ED or edge distance. That is the distance from the center of a hole to the nearest edge of the part. If a hole is too near an edge it lowers the strength of the part tremendously. In general, we use a minimum ED of 1.5 times the hole diameter, though I've been noticing lately that EDs of 1 are common in commercial products. If the bumps weren't there, the shafts supporting the small gears would be hanging out in space, either that or the wheel would be even heavier.

I think the design has been nicely optimized and well executed. If there were big ugly burrs hanging off the edge or chatter marks or the edges wandered like they had been cut with a hack saw then pras870 might have a point, but as it is I don't think so. It seems pretty obvious to me that those bumps were planned and needed to be just where they are. It is a professional looking job, good work 296!


Andy, you have us all dumbfounded... care to give us any hints?? :confused:




Whaddya mean?  We just are showing an example of how we are trying to be more organized this year.  You know, it's common practice to put wires on labels.  Now we are putting labels on parts of the robot.   294 has their operator interface labelled really nicely, and we really like the idea of making things clear.

Andy B.
One side of the cable plugs into the PWM input on the Victor, and the other goes to the PWM Outputs on the RC.  Make sure that you plug into both correctly.  The victor has the letters W,B,R to represent the color of the wire.  The RC also clearly labels which colors go where.

When it comes to connecting the PWM cable, it doesn't matter which type of motor is connected.  You will choose which RC output based on your software.

As a side note, the Spikes would plug into the Relay outputs of the RC.

Where do they plug into exactly on the robot controller? :confused:
They connect to the pins that say "PWM Outputs"

Third, make the power that the motors are driven at a little higher. I'm not sure if your problem was that it wasn't moving, but the way it is now, it will either move really slow or not at all.




The Victor 884 speed controllers have a deadpan (no movement spot) between 117 and 137 with 127 as neutral.  Therefore, you are not getting outside the speed controllers "don't move" range.

Increase the numbers to something like 90 and 164.

Phil
Boy this is a rough one. On one hand I love the working together and the camaraderie that has been formed here. I like the sharing of ideas and the fact that not only one team agreed on an idea but two, Wow.

On the other hand I like the fact that we made something that is unique to our team and when we are looked at by our friends and foes we try to make them say "I would have never thought of that". I don't see where this adds to the challenge of developing a concept except in a communication type of way. Part of our teams mission is to uninvent the cookie cutter and I think your teams have made a better cookie cutter. Is that good or bad I have no idea.

This type of thing is what I think makes FIRST an incredible competition field. Since I haven't checked could you build a robot from the white papers on this forum? If you could then what’s the problem of two teams going together. I think this idea will spark the most criticism from us Midwesterners since we are the more competition driven group. This whole debate has a very funny Republican / Democrat tone to it if you read it with a slight slant.
Al,

Who did you talk to at FIRST that said the wiring diagram is the the rule, rather then a suggestion?

I read &lt;R42&gt; as saying that the robot MUST be wired as the rules say. Then it refers to the power distribution diagram. It says that the power distribution diagram is a conveniance, which is far from saying that it is the bible.

As ttedrow points out, section 5.6.1 says that you may wire the speed controllers ground to the circuit breaker panel, with no mention of the ground stud for speed controllers connected to a 40 amp circuit.

Thats not what a little birdie told me... He told me that it has something more to do with your robot but would not give any sort of hints....

/me needs to somehow get into the TechnoKat circle...
I'll contact you via PM
It's quite clear to me what it says. ;)


It's quite clear to me what it says. ;)



Yep.  It says "qoqDeS"..lol.

David: Aren't the wires part of the robot?

Overall this is a pretty clever hint. :)  Although I don't really "know" what it is, but I know what it is...weird...


I agree that FIRST is intended to help spread and increase engineering knowledge, but the idea of two established teams sharing an identical design seems to have skewed the concept.  I feel personally that FIRST should be about each individual team sharing the work load and the joys and the pains that come along with engineering and manufacturing its own unique design.  While the idea of developing partnerships and friendships among colleagues and potential opponents is novel and advantageous, I feel that the fabrication, design, and communication that occurs as a single team creates and competes with its own robot cannot and should not be replaced.




This is partially my reasoning on it.

Giving each other design tips is great. Designing two identical robots where on team produces double of one part and the other team build the other is part is where it crosses the line for me.

I love to see the innovation that each team has separately.

I could see this happening nationwide in order to make everyone more efficient and competitve.  Can you imagine going to a regional where there are 50 teams but only 25 robots, just doubled?  Especially since FIRST has been trying to get more media coverage to bring more people in.  Can you imagine what someone might think watching this event where they watch identical robots competing with identical strategies?  I would think it was dull and unimaginative.

I've already touched on this subject of sort when talking about with holding secrets, not that secrets should be withheld but in that FIRST is awesome because the robots are unique.

We should make one plan for every robot and everyone can make the same robot that does everything and is in the limit of the rules and this would give rookies a level playing field.  The whole competition could be based on the best strategy.

I think collaboration is great, mass production goes against what FIRST is about.  I urge other teams not to repeat this in the coming years.  Build partnerships but don't build each other robot.  My econ teacher has went over how trading is good for everyone, but in this case I think it hurts FIRST.

Next year I would urge both 60 and 254 to use each other as sounding boards for design ideas and use each other for machining capabilities.  But don't split the workload on one robot design and then just double it.  But that is only my opinion.  I'd like to hear what everyone think about this one.

Yeah Scott, I can see that one.  We are competition-driven in Kansas.

And Joe, Please don't let any collaboration of this nature happen with delphi teams.  I'm already starting to get scared.  Many teams won't have the resources to compete effectively if team with resources enough begin to collaborate and double their resources.  I could see some pretty powerful hard to beat collaboration happening.

As a future note, may I ask that any future collaborators only collaborate with teams that go to a different regional.  &lt;edit out&gt;You could build complimenting robots that you make a deal that if one make the top eight the other makes the alliance and they work perfectly together.  Hey, I should do that. &lt;/edit out&gt;


The servo method does have one thing going for it.  The servo should stay in position after power is cut to your robot.  I think.  I'm not an electronics guy on the robot, but if the power to the servo gets cut then it will definitely stay in position.




The Servo will not move if there is no force applied to it on power-down.
We are using a servo to hold a brake mechanism for our winch.  When power off occurs, the spring tension will rotate the servo to a non stressed position.

For the purposes of activating a switch, the servo will not be "loaded' and therefore work for you.

Phil

(PS. I fly R/c planes and gliders so I know servos :)
Its A Winch!
Our Victors don't have a deadpan. going 107:147 makes our robot overshoot the line. (I thought the 883 had the deadpan, and not the 884.)

Our team has been trying to code the banners, and we just can't get it to work right.

If somebody can please post some working line fowolling code, I know all of us newbies woud greatly appreciate it.
This being a teaser, it's only showing part of the leopard.  It's mostly intended to partially show off the distressed look that we're going for and that I've been informed is the new hotness with all the kids these days.  Having a disfunctional fashion sense, I wouldn't know myself.

Oddly enough, though, just a few days ago I was telling my bro (our graphics designer) that it was now only a matter of time before FIRST had a team of Thnikkamen or some other Homestar related theme.

Holy cow, cool looking.  Only thing that really jumps out is the such small size of that shaft and bolt holding the thing on.  I'd think that would likely sheer off really easily.  You might want to look into putting a larger on on there.


Our Victors don't have a deadpan.



Are you using the 884's in the kit?  They do have a deadpan.

Also, calibrate the Victors.  This might be your problem.

Phil
We're using two Banners (we're a rookie team and we only have two), one on either side of the line.  We're going to space them out a bit and try to "waddle" down the line.  We haven't been able to test yet because our drive train guys are having some issues.  I have no idea if our scheme will work...if not we're going to dead-reckon using a real-time clock.
I hate to sound mean, but you should really read the IFI docs. Everything you're asking about is explained VERY clearly in the information provided by IFI - you'll be better prepared to work with the control system if you have a fair amount of familiarity with it, and spending 20 minutes flipping through the manual is a good way to gain that familiarity.

we have not the time
merci anyway
just out of curiosity......

is this an improved method of your 6 motor drive train?   That was so cool at West Michigan last year.
Plug the one end into the Victor with the black wire closest to the fan.
Plug the other end into a set of 3pins on the Robot controller that is labeled PWM Outputs.
The number of the PWM (1-16) is the number you need to use in the code to control that particular speed controller.

ie.
We have a Victor for the left drive that is conected to PWM16
The right Drive motor connected to PWM15.

In Our code we say


pwm15 = 254;
pwm16 = 0;    // reversed due to motors pointing opposite.


and our robot will go forward at full speed.

If we plugged the motors into pwm1 and pwm2, and used the above code, the robot would not be sending the signals to the right jacks.

Hope this helps.
Remember frustration will just frustrate you farther and nothing will get accomplished.
Reading the documentation is always a good idea and will assist in clarifying what you are trying to do. :)

It's the van door motors shaft (the longer one).  We lifted 128 pounds (4 cement brick) running a winch on the shaft with that motor.  And we did it w/out supporting the shaft.  You won't sheer that.  A better nut perhap, nylon locking.

Congratulations on pioneering an amazing new way of approaching our competition.  I have a feeling that a few years from now your two teams will be the answer to a FIRST trivia question.  "Which two teams were the first to build the same robot?"  Next year I'm sure many other teams will follow suit.




Too late. The answer is 254 and I think 253, the Bay City Bombers (who no longer exist) in 1999 at the first Sillicon Valley Regional. So this is not new territory for the Cheesy Poofs, just the distance has changed. BTW it should be noted that 60 and 254 won't be at the same competition until Nationals.
A little info on shear ratings


Shear Capacity Calculation

To roughly calculate the ultimate single shear capacity of a bolt, multiply bolt area at full shank diameter times ultimate shear strength rating, e.g. 8-32 18-8 stainless steel bolt, 0.164" diameter. (A standard 8-32)

Area = πr2; 3.1416 x 0.082" x 0.082" = 0.0211 square inches

Single shear = 90,000 psi x 0.021 = 1890 lbs. at full diameter

This calculation is for shearing a 8-32 on the thread.  I am pretty confident it will hold your robot.

I believe it was team 252.  But yes, that year their robots were almost identical and placed first and second overall at the regional competition.  Correct me if I am wrong.
Collaboration is Great!
Kudos to you.
I "real" life, several teams need to interact and share for the betterment of the business as a whole.

Well done.

Van door motor
And it's also running through a victor and we need to know which PWm to plug the red, black, and white wire into; or is it a relay?
I'm trying to do something similar to what codemonkey is doing.  How would I go about making a switchbox for the robot (to attach to the rc)?  Basically how do I return a "1" to a digital input.
A victor is a speed controller.

If you are using the default code that came with the Rc, it will be plugged into PWM03, and it will be controlled by the port 3 x axis (pretty sure..) You can easily change this by modifying the mappings of inputs to outputs in the default code provided by innovation first.
We are using 4 motors on our bot and all of them are used through pwms connected to victors.

Shway.

Before someone explodes something, Servos go straight to PWM outputs, not through relays.  Also, it's more that you're allowed to use relays on the seat and window motors.  You're also allowed to use victors on them as well.  You're just not allowed to use relays on the drill, CIM, Globe, or fisher-price motors.


Where's the CODE RED mountain dew??? ;)




Our robot drank it all.
interesting idea.....ill be interested to see this @ UCF


I'm trying to do something similar to what codemonkey is doing.  How would I go about making a switchbox for the robot (to attach to the rc)?  Basically how do I return a "1" to a digital input.




it's really just a matter of closing the circuit between the GND and SIG pins of the digital input (someone correct me if I'm wrong). just hook up a switch in between the pins.
I *love* the military toggle... I've been meaning to get one of those, but the cheapest I've found 'em for is about 8, 10 bucks - which in my mind is a ripoff for an extra piece of red plastic.  Where did you guys get that?
just link to it - not all applications play the video inline with the browser, so you'd end up just giving a useless extra blank window to some users.


Erich,
I know you don't want to hear this but the suggested replacement is a SFB1MAXPT which is a single maxi block. (See Team update #9 page 3) The one you describe which has a common input and three or four outputs is not allowed.  Sorry, I questioned FIRST on this last week.  The original four independent fuse holders on a single block or four single blocks are the only allowable parts. The SFB1MAXPT snaps together to form larger blocks.
BTW see my post about terminating #6 & #10 wires into these blocks here in the electrical forum.  They are designed for #4 - #8 wire but only grab about half of a #6 and about a 1/4 of #10 strands.  If you use super flexible wire, then even less of the strands are captured.



I was under the impression that all of the SFB*MAX's were allowed.  I know i have seen many teams using the 4 fuse one (most like the one in the kit), and we just purchased the 3 fuse because of availability.

I now do see on update 9 the problem, but why must they keep doing this to us?  I just spent 40 bucks on this one (before the update), and we dont have the monitary resources for anything else.  I wonder if this will clear because it was like this before the update (like with the soldering of the blue wires on the drill motor).

If anyone can post on the Q&A about this discrepancy, and whether any of the SFB*MAX's will be applicable (seeing as the SFB3MAX is the same one as 3 SFB1MAX's), i would be very thankful.

Today we did wire in the distro block, as well as the ground stud, although it really sucked to have to do all that crap when it was wired more efficently the other way.

ETA: The wording on the fuse box says : "Maxi-Fuse Panel Option" , which implies that you can use any fuse holder, but this is just one they recommend.  Right now we dont have the option of purchasing another one, due both to money limits (1200 bucks goes mighty fast!), and time issues, so we are kind of stuck with the 3.
use an 8-way rotary switch. This way you can have up to 8 selections and it would be very easy to wire and program


When you have 3 pieces of bosh extruded alumimum and a pair of safty glasses on top of your computer screen.




So *thats* were Ziff 2.0 went.
It's your cart right?  Looks really cool


A little info on shear ratings

Shear Capacity Calculation

To roughly calculate the ultimate single shear capacity of a bolt, multiply bolt area at full shank diameter times ultimate shear strength rating, e.g. 8-32 18-8 stainless steel bolt, 0.164" diameter. (A standard 8-32)

Area = πr2; 3.1416 x 0.082" x 0.082" = 0.0211 square inches

Single shear = 90,000 psi x 0.021 = 1890 lbs. at full diameter

This calculation is for shearing a 8-32 on the thread. I am pretty confident it will hold your robot.


Consider that bolt not flush against the load.. such as a tiny "negligible" bending moment of only .25 inches....

Stress = M * y / I

Stress = M * y / I

130 lbs * .125 * .082 in / (3.141 * .164^4/64) = **75,500 PSI**

Compound that with some shear stress... you're in a danger zone. Consider and extra load of an extra robot hanging with you... eek! In my opinion.. using a #8 bolt is definitely pushing a reasonable factor of safety.

However, the van door motor, being 11mm or so, should work out to be just fine.. but I'd definitely try to avoiding doing anything cantilevered... that freaks me out. Keep in mind that those bearing are bought from the cheapest bidder...

Nevertheless, good luck!

Matt
Teasers of a cart? Dang and it looks better than our robot. Good job.
wow...you guys make my team look like rubbish now.  im ashamed.  we just decided to go for the 10 point ball...lol.  can i join yer team guys?  ill pay! ;)
Thanks, that was what I was hoping, the RC guide was unclear to me.  Is it legal to use limit switches provided by innovation first in the EDU kit on the robot?  We ordered some extra ones.  I would have to rewire them because the +5v pin is in the middle of the grounds and sig's and they only have a 2 pin connector  :rolleyes:
man...nm...i forgot to post it but i got the solution.  pay no head to this thread now.
looks like their 2002 robot, methinks.

I think you can keep on working on it, but you should remember that judges may begin to evaluate it right after the due date (so they might not see your changes).


Team 25's made our buttons for the season and some appropriately colored Soda Bottle Shakers. The Volcano Crew's next project is team costumes.




Careful with those shakers because of the no noisemaker rule this year.


it's really just a matter of closing the circuit between the GND and SIG pins of the digital input (someone correct me if I'm wrong). just hook up a switch in between the pins.


Actually, and somebody should correct *me* if I'm wrong, the pins are pull ups, meaning they are normally on unless something connects the GND and SIG pins, which pushes them off. So, to turn it on, you *don't* close the GND and SIG pins. :eek: Or, I could be totally wrong and you'll have to yell at me. ;)
They do allow, and encourage, changes after the 20th.  The judges may or may not see them, though.


Where you hiding them?!?


Bill has one and we have one.
We had our first late night 2/15/2004, we were here till midnight.....it may not sound that late to ya'all, but to me its killer. Computhief263 knows i need my sleep. lol
I'm thinking it returns a "1" if you *do* close them, there is an indicator LED on the RC, too bad I don't have access to the "robot room" today to test this.  I attached a banner sensor once, though, to a digital input and it indicated the switch variable was equal to "1" when the banner sensor detected white, that was of course with the white wire from the banner sensor..... oh well I'll figure out what it does tomorrow lol
you need to declare armcounter as a static int. Otherwise, it gets created and destroyed on the stack each time you enter and leave the function.
Wow.  Good Memories. Figures that as I read this, Aerosmith's song, "Don't Wanna miss a Thing" comes on...*sigh*


We just got a ADXRS150EB, and we're trying to figure out how to hook it up to our robot. Can anyone tell us how they wired theirs? Thanks!



Check the documentation for the location of the pins. Pin 1 will be square.

Ground pins 8 & 12
+5v to pins 1 & 13
signal to pin 2
Wow 890 posts on here of nothing but truth and fantasy lol. What a great thread.

......when you go to your HS to help build the robot for a couple of hours and then leave to go to your actual job.

.......when you consider taking your circular saw apart to use the motor out of there to see if its better then the 1/2 drill motors FIRST provides

12p - 8p fri / sat off. thats the best schedule my job has to offer. i spend more time with robotics then i thought ever possible and thats with a job.


Ok well, I'm trying to run through a loop where it does

armcounter++;

Armcounter is defined at the top of user_routines_fast.c.  I try a print_f to print out armcounter but it gives [null] on the ifi_loader.  My motors just keep running for ever because it doesn't ever have armcount equal to the number I supply.  Any clues????? :confused::ahh:


You'd have to show me how you have the printf setup, but you probably got it wrong. This should be similar to what your printf should be:


printf("
Arm counter: %i
", (int)armcounter);



you need to declare armcounter as a static int. Otherwise, it gets created and destroyed on the stack each time you enter and leave the function.


He says at the top of user_routines_fast.c. I assume that means he made it a global.

PS What type is armcounter?


We're using two Banners (we're a rookie team and we only have two), one on either side of the line.  We're going to space them out a bit and try to "waddle" down the line.  We haven't been able to test yet because our drive train guys are having some issues.  I have no idea if our scheme will work...if not we're going to dead-reckon using a real-time clock.


We're rookies too, but we bought a third. The setup has three mostly as a result of an earlier design that got thrown away, but we had already ordered the third, so we decided to use it. :)
wow that is pretty sweet but looks reawlly heavy

what is the weight?
and are you gonna make it in the box for height and width restrictions?
Thanks!
now see its an illusion that its too big. The actual size is only 1 foot high by 7 inches long. Those qre toothpicks in the backround, shaped into the exact scale down of pvc pipes
Team 219 is also using 3 banners, so that only 1 will be on the line at a time. (separated exactly 2 15/32 ").  We have tested to make it down the line all the way in roughly 10 seconds.  We did try 2 banner sensors, but we needed to reduce speed too much to keep us from getting off the line completely.


Check the documentation for the location of the pins. Pin 1 will be square.

Ground pins 8 & 12
+5v to pins 1 & 13
signal to pin 2



Thanks, works great. Our problem was that we didn't have +5v into pin 13.
if im not mistaken i think there was a screw hole in them. where you can mount them like a picture frame. if you epoxy them and FIRST wants you to move them else where well you get the idea! all you need is a small hole if there isn't already one there and put a small screw to hole it up.



***quote/   ReggieB also on mounting- Can we cover up a corner (or two) of the led's for mounting?***

covering a corner or two ??? don't know what your talking about (the edges or the front of the face plate?) if its the front you may need an official ruling if its the side of the led then i don't see why not!
The Woodie Flowers submission is due on February 27, 2004.
You can find that information in section 8.4.5 of the manual or on firstawards.org (which is where you will actually do the submission)


Our team has been trying to code the banners, and we just can't get it to work right.

If somebody can please post some working line fowolling code, I know all of us newbies woud greatly appreciate it.


Well, I can't guarrantee this works, but if you want to look at it... :)


// Check if the right sensor is reading the line
if(lineDetectorLeft == ON_LINE)
{
// Turn right
driveMotorLeft = 127;
driveMotorRight = 254;
}
else if(lineDetectorRight == ON_LINE)
{
// Turn left
driveMotorLeft = 254;
driveMotorRight = 127;
}
else
{
// Go forward
driveMotorLeft = 254;
driveMotorRight = 254;
}



Subsitute pwmXX for the driveMotorLeft and Rights, the lineDetectorLeft and Rights with the digital inputs they are on, and the ON_LINEs with the value that the sensors read when over the line. This is a very simple algorithm and can be improved, but it gives you the idea. Put it in its own function and continually call it and it will (should) faithfully follow a line.

--EDIT--
You can also adjust the speeds passed to the motors. The way it is now, it might lose the line because it is too fast. :)
That's a pretty scary but brilliant idea, in my personal opinion. So which one of you gets the credit for it?

Call me jaded, but FIRSTers are driven by awards and recognition. It's in our blood (though we don't like to admit it). What happens when both of you go after the same angle on your Chairman's application? Unless the rules change, only one of you can get the credit for it.

True, if any team was to break the glass ceiling of "no teams beyond 200 have ever won the Chairmans Award", it would be 254...they definitely mirror the resources and support of a pre-200 team. But if one of you wins with it, the other team needs to find another angle to take next year, because that idea is now "old hat" to the judges. And knowing FIRST teams (for the most part), once an idea is recognized, all development on it ceases - because it has served its purpose.

I think inter-team partnerships are great...I used to do it myself. But just as in those old movies with the business partner running off with all the money, things like that happen today, and a team who you thought you knew may not be one who you knew at all. And no, I'm not saying that against either of you in particular, you both are outstanding teams, I'm saying it because you just need to be sure you trust the team you're collaborating with.

As for the collaboration aspect, I honestly would be terrified if all 16 Delphi teams had the same game design (or any multiple of teams, for that matter...I'm not just picking on Delphi ;) ). Especially with their game experience, if everyone did this, it would stifle the rookie retention rate. I can absolutley see it turning into leagues of teams that "acquire" younger teams into their pipeline or shutting out teams that they didn't like. And I honestly don't want to see Dean take up an SEC role.

Please don't get all upset about my viewpoint - it is only a viewpoint, and its not an angry one, just something from an old FIRSTer who's been through the trials and tribulations of collaboration and who cares about both of your teams.
its a short.
Hey...know a place where you can find links from all 2003´s participants... unfortunately you won´t be able to see the rookie teams, though  :(

I doubt that there is a .25 inch gap.  I assume this because most team dont manufacture parts like that to within 250 thousandths.  I believe if there was "a tiny "negligible" bending moment" it would only be that of 1-2 thousandths.  Especially considering that the nut on the end would hold it all flush.


Does anyone by chance have a complete list of teams and website links for the teams or know where i can get it?

Kinda would save me some time making it from scratch.

Thanks

That's the link to the map. Hope thats what youre looking for!
Simple solution. If it is blinking yellow after you programming it, chances are you just don't have your operator interface hooked up. The programming was still most likely a success. All you have to do now is reset the RC then it should be programmed. To get rid of a yellow blinking light after you program and to allow the reset command the operator interface must be tethered or communicating via radio.

Thanks,
Ryan Waliany


its a short.


Try the printf I showed earlier. It should work. Just copy and paste it over your old one.
That's a cool winch drum but it looks liek it would be really heavy.
w00t mad props to me for the wheels :D ;)
Well, at least you'll have a robust robot and know how to fix it quick.  I busted a drill motor transmission yesterday (Use the broccoli bands).  But we learned that our coupler will seize onto the shaft and we will need more for competition if we have to switch out a transmission.

As for your person, there will always be people who think like this.  There are way to handle this in the long run and short run.  I think you are looking for a short run solution.

First plan is diversion.  Have them help with chairman's, fundraising, scrap book, or other commitee or job that keep them out of the way.  Put them in something they know nothing about and let them learn.  Now this might not seem right and they might complain but I speaking in the short term.

Second, extreme supervision.  Be by them whenever they try to do anything on the robot.  Be ultra critical and remind them that this is everyone robot and they need to treat it with respect.  And constantly say measure twice cut once.  KISS.  Or any other slogan that reminds them what they are doing.  This might not be efficient use of time.

Third, schedule the meeting earlier in secret and lock the doors.  This will work for at least a couple meeting.  Work long hour when he is not their and perfect your robot to your liking and then lock it in a safe.  When he finally shows up again and you let him in tell him that you shipped the robot.  This should trick him as long as he has no access to the internet.

Fourth, add a quality control committee (I know it can be extremely inefficient) that has to approve every adjustment on the robot.  We have one of these for most documents, e-mails, paperwork of most kind, the website, but I slip past it.

I'll add long term choices later...But I have to go to class...It's snowing and it inhales audibly.

We had our first late night 2/15/2004, we were here till midnight.....it may not sound that late to ya'all, but to me its killer. Computhief263 knows i need my sleep. lol




LMAO, yes mary i kno how much u value  your sleep. Altho maybe u should giv insomnia a try like me B-P

Note: that would most likly never happen....or would it * ETish x-files theme begins to play in the background*
There are a few points here that need to be clarified.

First -- Yes, we did collaborate, and make the same robot. However, it is NOT the exact same robot.  Each of our teams made small adjustments that the other did not.  The robot is wired differently, and we will have different programs.  We can't wait to see the Poofs at Nats and see what it comes down to.  Who will win?  Only strategy and driver skill will seperate us.

Second -- I cannot think of a team that we could trust any more than the Cheesy Poofs.  When they submit their Chairman's Award entry, I hope that they include our alliance.  And we will do the same.  I think that people are missing the point that we are acting as *one team*.  If the Cheesy Poofs win an award for design, or for performance, or any other award, we can feel that we share it.  We each worked on the other's robots, and we are each equally part of the alliance.


On team 60, we're so close that we've become family.  (Advisors, Machinists, Students, and Parents included)  We've done so much together, that it is practically impossible not to be so close.
We wanted to work with 254, who we consider an extended group of our family to show everyone what kind of collaboration is possible, when you're NOT worrying about "yourself" and "your own team's awards".  Now we're working together to worry about "us" and "our team's achievements".

Hee. How convenient that the yellow fence thing was the same height as the bar!

Looks good, can't wait to see it in action!
I can't tell how it actually lifts itself.  I assume the screwdriver goes through the mounting bushing in a pneumatic cyliner.
ok I did and now theres nothing there, its not printing anything.
You can't just shut them out of everything.

Our team has had its share of problems with this in the past.  We've had people in the pit that knew nothing about our robot or anything it can do.  And they were talking to scouts from other teams! (and I can say, from personal experience, that there are two sides you can look at this from)

1. Your side.  The kid's a nuisance.  Trying to get into everything, and only making a mess. What you could do is talk to him, make him feel a little more involved with the team.  Educate him.  Teach him how not to be a pest.  Chances are, he's just trying to fit in, to live up to your (and everyone else's) expectations.

2. His side.  He's in the middle of a place that he honestly knows nothing about.  He's blown away.  I mean, seriously, how often to kids get to see a robot that they can play with.  People in my school don't even know anything about the robotics team.  They have no idea what we do.  He'll want to get hands on experience.  Maybe he's a little too stubborn to admit when he's wrong, but that's when you step in and tell him how to fix the problem.

I think that you should just try to help him out.  I've been in this position, and I know what it's like to be isolated from the team.

You never know, some day he might start working his butt off, knowing what he's doing,  and prove to be very helpful.


Amanda M
Team60
But you're not the same team. If you want to be considered as one team, then merge and register under the same number. I personally think that would be an innovative idea....teams working from different states to produce one robot...it seems to be more of what you both are going after. But until you merge, you are still in the competition's eyes as two separate teams, walking a fine line hand in hand.

Sometimes things may start out good, but then something happens that compromises that relationship. I've seen it happen too many times to think it won't happen this time, no matter how good you say your relationship is....and that's what I'm worried about...and it's something you both need to think about.


ok I did and now theres nothing there, its not printing anything.


Hum, well, try just using the following line. It's guarranteed to print and if it doesn't, it means that it is never getting called and you'll have to look at your code.



printf("Test");




--EDIT--
If it doesn't work then post your code and people can look at it.


I *love* the military toggle... I've been meaning to get one of those, but the cheapest I've found 'em for is about 8, 10 bucks - which in my mind is a ripoff for an extra piece of red plastic. Where did you guys get that?


Wish I knew your supplier - we got ours at Summit Racing for $14.  It's built well, though.

John,

I have many a fond memory of the 2001 season as well, it was a great year. I always got a kick out of your enthusiasm and wide eyed wonder with everything as it happened that year.

John has done a lot for me since the day that I met him, from getting me a job at BAE, to being a good friend and mentor. You are very deserving of this award. Congratulations, I look forward to seeing you and swapping stories at the BAE Regional.

I agree with the quality control committee idea. It may be inefficient, but it's better than having something totally wrong in the end.

The biggest thing is communication. Point out (politely) what he is doing wrong. The best way is to show that you know what you are talking about, and have others back you up. If he says "left," explain some reasons why you should go "right." But show respect for him.

Do you have someone with a strong influence on the team? Like someone who everyone listens to and respects? If so, then sit down with that person and the new team member and talk about what you have a problem with.

Other than that, I guess I'm having trouble seeing why your mentors (engineers, teachers) don't step in. That's part of FIRST - people who know teaching the people that don't know.

Hope this helps.
i was gonna make a new thread, but i'll just post here...

is it alright to alter the fisher proce gearbox. Reason being is we need a light motor like the fisher price. But, it runs to slow for with the gearbox and too fast without it. Could we alter the box to our liking?


It printed test but here it is. I'm using a basic auto right now so i can debug everything first.


What exactly is the output say? Does the 'arm *value of armcounter*' print anything? What does it print?

--EDIT--
Try changing the %i in the printf to %d.
Too heavy. It's at the shop being turned down. We thought 3/4 inch was a little too sturdy.
I like those books - I haven't read them all yet but I'm working on it.  They're pretty good.  Funny too.
Smaller, lighter and .......

More to come later.
Thanks guys! :D
i havent looked at that code, but it seems it is calling the autonomous mode function with a trigger. On the operator interface, there is a pin in the competetion port that controls "autonomous mode" really what that means is in the default code, when the pin in question goes high, it calls the autonomous mode function. This can be located in user_routines_fast.c. This is how auto mode will be initiated at competitions. You could leave the trigger mapped to start it, but i wouldnt because it may be hit during a match and start up an unwanted auto mode
A few things I saw after glancing at it:


if (armcounter = 15) //will raise arm.
pwm06=0;
else
armcounter++;
pwm06=255;


sould be


if (armcounter == 15) //will raise arm.
pwm06=0;
else {
armcounter++;
pwm06=255;
}



It is VERY rare that you'll actually want to use a single = in an if, so watch out for that, and also be careful with your curly braces.

That said, I believe the code in its original form should have printf'd 15 over and over and over.  Was it doing that, or just not printing anything?


Hello, We are wondering how auto. mode will be started at the regionals because people are using the code on kevin.org and to start all of that you need to push the trigger. So if I could get a little knowledge from you guys that would be great. We have a robot that can track IR. Now were are wondering about the beacon switch part of the robot? Is the beacon switch a hardware devise or is it something we define in the program like beacon type 0 or beacon type 1?
Thanks for your help.


Look in main.c and you will see a check on *autonomous_mode. *This is set by the arena controllers at competition, and is your signal to start your autonomous mode. You can imitate this startup yourself with a competition box. See IFI for directions on making one.

The navigate code must be modified to be called from your User_Autonomous_Code() and eliminated the push button start.
See some details here /t/ir-pmw-help/49875/1

You need a standard on/off switch to tell your program which beacon to look for. It can be connected to digital input pin 7 signal and ground pins (don't use the +5v middle pin). rc_dig_in07 is then used by the tracker code to tell which beacon to look for.

Missing a = is an easy thing to do. It's one of those powerful, useful things that C/C++ lets you do, but isn't what you want most of the time. :)


USE QMAIL! I run Qmail and Courier-IMAP off of a BSD box (MacOSX is based off of BSD) in my home and it works great. I host mail for 8 domains off a DSL line.




I have QMail running on the machine. So, I can just follow the LifeWithQmail directions and ignore the consequences of having a closed-relay server, as long as I tell people to use their own ISP's SMTP?

Randy, thanks for the offer, but since this box will be hosting sites other than our FIRST thing, I think it's better off if we just do it this way. You guys beat us to it--we were going to start offering free webhosting to people. We've got everything finalized except for email and Darwin Streaming Server.

--Petey
Try to realize this is a problem (just like them not knowing how a "system" on the robot works) and do your best to help and mentor him (them).

If he truly means well he should realize after being helped that he is hurting not helping the team.

So, the "test" prints, but the other thing doesn't?


Hum, well, try just using the following line. It's guarranteed to print and if it doesn't, it means that it is never getting called and you'll have to look at your code.



printf("Test");




--EDIT--
If it doesn't work then post your code and people can look at it.




Try

printf("Test
");

instead.  If it works anything like printf on any other system, it won't flush the buffer until it gets a newline...

Yeah, that is true, but it did print for him. The wierd thing is, at least from what he has said, the line that is right below it doesn't say print anything, even though it should. :confused:
As far as the placement of the screw holes, you should be able to get them from one of the models at firstcadlibrary.com

As far as modifying the Fisher price gearbox, that is allowed. You aren't allowed to modify the motors themselves, but non-integral gearboxes are OK. See the thread in which a team took one of the stages out of the drill gearbox.

Let's take a look at a letter from someone sharing their experience about having such student on their team.

*******************************************************
but he thinks he knows everything about our robot, even thought he hadn't been to a meeting untill 4 weeks into the build season.




The adults who show up for 1 day, and have strong opinions and behavior to insist how things be done, the students who show up periodically and have strong feelings then disappear while the core students and mentors are working on his project to finish it and he reappears to pick up his project again, mentors who are here far less than other mentors and think they are the only one who can build a robot, or their not being here is the reason for every failure that in reality is a learning experience, and they believe they can override the core mentors' decisions. How 'bout the parent who wants her kids on the team, they don't attend the kickoff, or the meetings for the week after, so they aren't assigned on a subteam, she complains by email how our team does things administratively tho they haven't even been attending, then they do show up and her expectations were that we tutor her kids in person when they did finally arrive. She left in a huff cuz that didn't happen within the two hours she allowed them to be here.

Yeh, been there.
im split on the idea...


i do like the idea that teams are forming together, and cooperating.


however...

i dont think its right to do what 60 and 254 did. i mean its kinda cheap. yuo have one team design half the robot, and the other team do the other half. there are teams who are running themselves ragged trying to accomplish a goal. the whole concept of FIRST is to have unique designs. and gauranteed, its a good way to promote first's unity. its bad that the two teams only have to do half the work. its kinda unfair, but what can you do, disqualify them? no because they broke no rule. however, i think it a kick to the chest for some teams. just my 2cents worth.
Well for the variable, it print Arm and then nothing after it.
Could you paste the output from the code here?
Well, I can't figure it out. It should work. Any suggestions, The Lucas?

looks pretty good guys.. just wondering.. those arms you are hanging on will be used to grab the 2x ball, correct. Does your bot do any other functions than hang and grab multiplier?
Dealing with people who "know it all" can be a bit of a challenge.  But, in the long run, it can also be very helpful.  While "know it alls" can be annoying, sometimes they do have a point.  Listen to the observations they make.  They may be wrong 9 out of 10 times but you need to be listening the 10th time.

Outside of that, one of the hardest lessons to learn (I know, I've had to do it time and time again) is that just because you've done something one way in the past does not mean it's the right way, it's the best way, or that it's the way that it should be done this time.

The final thing that I should mention is that it sounds like you have a personality conflict on your team.  Personality conflicts almost always involve two people.  So I'm saying also look towards how you act and see if changing your behavior will help influence the other person.

Matt
ROTFLMAO!!! I GOT IT!!!

HINT: look at how the sentences are structured ;)
Well done Team 60 & 254! I think what you have done is great. Having worked on projects that require input, collaboration, agreement and shared work from different locations on the map, I can honestly say this is no easy feat!   Anyone that thinks of this as a "shortcut" is missing the entire picture. You have added a layer of complexity to an already complex, stress-filled project. The end results.... I'm sure 2 awesome robots, but more importantly, students that may tackle future projects/problems with a better understanding of cooperation and working towards a common goal. And in my opinion we can't get enough of those students in the work force fast enough!
or maybe its one of those fancy screwdrivers with the magnetic tip
Well its counting now.


Last week I posted a question and got no response so I'm going to try one last time. So now that I've got you attention:

Does anybody know what the tooth profile is on the final gear in the Fisher-Price gearbox?. The best I can measure the pitch is 14. But what is the pressure angle? It looks to be more than 20deg.

The first person with a correct response will recieve, absolutely free, a custom encoder gear to use as you see fit. Correctness will be determined by the mesh of a fabricated gear with the FP gear. Partial credit if you can tell me how to figure out what the pressure angle is with a pair of calipers and not much else.

ChrisH



Chris,

I seriously doubt that it is a 14 DP.  It is almost certainly 20 deg pressure angle.

What is the OD?  To first order, the OD is (2+Nteeth)/DP  Does this match up.

I confess that I don't have the gear in hand so I can  only advise.

From talking to the folks at Fisher Price (several years ago, when I was explaining FIRST and begging them to donate motors/gearboxes) I am fairly sure it is an English gear, that it is not modified (enlarged) and that it is a standard 20 degree pressure angle gear.  But... ...time passes, perhaps they have gone more exotic designs.

I wish I had more for you.

Who is planning on using pneumatic, aka 2" bore cyclinder 170 lb retracting force, etc..., to lift their robot off the ground at the end?

I can't convince my team to do it even though I have a very clever way to make it work.

Any ideas on how you'll do it would be nice.

edit:  I will be willing to share my idea considering that you aren't attending LSR (Lone star) and aren't currently qualified for national or when my team decides to  not use if for sure.  This method may seem controversial when used but is legal and will probably not be used by any other team, unless I can convince mine.

Yeah I have a question.  Is that a Van Door motor coupled directly to an FP?  Also, is that an end mill sticking out of there?  Last, it's quite hard to tell exactly what this thing does and how it works, but maybe you intended for us to remain clueless.

EDIT: I think I can spot a window motor too!  What the heck!?!?  Care to fill us in?
Thanks for working with another team, I really support this.  Our team was planning on either working with another team or having their students become a part of ours, but the plans fell through for one reason or another.  Doing this is really displaying the spirit of FIRST, so keep up the good work.

And now for the rest of the message: That is one sweet robot.  I can't wait to see it work (Could we get some video?).  So here's to you Team 254 and Team 60, that is a very nice job.  I just want to know how the big arm thingy works, cause all I can see right now just shows that it's probably very crazy.

Try changing the %i in the printf to %d.




Remeber that IFI implemented printf and that it isn't a "standard" implementation. Only the %s, %lx, %d, %x, %u, %X directives are parsed.

Catastrophy, is your problem fixed now that it is counting, or do you have more problems?

How well does it work.  Do you have to run the compressor the whole time or can you charge to 120 psi and do it without the compressor?

-On the navigation bar move the small gear image a little to the right.
-Center the FIRST image on the nav bar
-Move the Multimedia gear down

And a question:

Yes, I believe they are coupled directly.  This is for the base or the arm to move up and down.  Yes, that is an end mill, because we ran out of shaft.  Whatever works.  Yes, you do see a window motor as well, that powers a joint further up in the arm.  All will be answered at the SCRRF sectional.

I'm not quite sure if that's right, but I'm almost positive that it is.

Ah! The classic case of “I know everything”. It happens almost every year with some of my teams. Sometimes it’s a senior, sometimes it’s is rookie member with that’s strong-minded (and narrow-mind) and sometimes a new mentor/teacher. This happen to one of my teams this year, another “want-to-help” teacher step in at the end of 3 weeks and said the design will not work and should be changed.

This time, I had to take him to the side with the team’s head coach and explained that the team rules agreed to at the beginning of the six-week building period is “No design change after the design is voted on by the members; unless there is a serious fault.”
The decisions are made by majority student vote so the students controls theirs own destiny. But the coaches and mentors have final say to design changes.

In the past (I recalled twice) I have not step in to stop the team from “Following the Piper.” A person have convinced the team that “He know what’s right for team” even thought it was a formula for disaster. Why?  Because in FIRST, failure is an opinion if the students will learn from their mistakes. If the team opinion is strong and they out vote the mentor & coaches, it is better to support them and allow them to slowly mature and understand their mistake then to force them in to a design the adults come up with. (Also we could be wrong too; not often!!)

Last year, one student member was confronted by the whole team and asked to change or leave because of his negative opinions and disruptive behavior. He had a funny way of expressing himself in a negatively and was bring the team down. He reconsidered his behavior and apologies to the team.

My recommendation to you is to ask this new member to join in the team’s work but not to disrupt the team’s progress. Your organization also dictates the chain of commend on member behavior too.  I feel all disruptive members will hurt the team in the long run. In FIRST, no member is that crucial and no individual know it all.
Good Luck.

OK the problem that we been having is that we  can't make the autonomus period for the robot, we put one of the programs we made on users routine fast but it doesn't work please if you could tell us were to put or what do we need to make it work because the program does not work please help.   :confused:  :confused:  :confused:

if this collaboration is the greatest thing since sliced bread then why even have the robot COMPETITION at all?  shouldn't we all just get together and try to come up with one really great robot idea that is simply awesome?  wouldn't that just be the greatest?  no.  competition makes America what it is.  competition between teams, companies, democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives...without competition nothing ever really gets better.  without competition healthcare doesn't get faster and cheaper, cars don't get better gas mileage, and things progress much more slowly than before.  I hope...no, I PRAY...that Cyber Blue never, never, never NEVER goes to this idea.  Cooperation is one thing, so is helping a team at a competition, or mentoring them, or posting a white paper, or showing pictures, or this or that... but the bottom line is building two identicle robots is not the same as these things and therefore should not be compared to them...come on :(

Third, schedule the meeting earlier in secret and lock the doors.  This will work for at least a couple meeting.  Work long hour when he is not their and perfect your robot to your liking and then lock it in a safe.  When he finally shows up again and you let him in tell him that you shipped the robot.  This should trick him as long as he has no access to the internet.







I would not reccomend doing this at all. When it leaks out this student would be extremely mad- what I would reccomend doing is give him a rather tough task. Since this kid knows it all, tell him not to bother anyone else because they're all focused on their task. Chances are, he'll mess up the part, so partner him up with a senior student who can guide him through the steps.

If nothing else works, I'd have one of the team leaders (student or adult, whatever) have a little 'chit chat' with him. They should directly tell him he does not know everything and this is not a toy. Emphasize how there is no need to impress everyone or to know it all.

good luck- hope this kid learns how to be a productive team member

Don't worry, John.
Writing up a process that will minimalize our  presence here on the site, so not to annoy anyone anymore.
At one time, our team had a cable called a high-octane cable. This cable, in theory, allowed us to charge one battery from multiple chargers. Needless to say, its use has been discontinued.

We are still using the battery charger we got in the 2001 season - our 6A charger emitted a cloud of bad smell last year (but oddly no smoke) and was disposed of. I owned one of those 6A chargers myself, but it too broke, in a similar manner. Both of these chargers I had seen had broken while charging very old FIRST batteries, made by Yuasa, probably from the 2000 season.

I have a question for the electrical wizards out there. How would a charging system be properly designed to charge multiple batteries at one? I would think a nicely setup diode layout would prevent one battery trying to charge another, even if there was a chance for something like that. I spent plenty of time last year trying to design one, but I couldn't get enough diodes for the purpose. The problem becomes interesting, because each battery in the mesh will have discharged differently, and some batteries are older/stranger than others, and have different internal resistances.
From my interpretation of the non-functional decoration rule, the lazer sight MUST not affect the outcome of the game (it might show up along with the IR signal) and it MUST be powered by the on-board battery, not it's own battery.

Question, why would you do it? It just seems like way too much work for nothing IMHO.


i was gonna make a new thread, but i'll just post here...

is it alright to alter the fisher proce gearbox. Reason being is we need a light motor like the fisher price. But, it runs to slow for with the gearbox and too fast without it. Could we alter the box to our liking?




yep, i spent the entire day lathing a piece for a specific gear then sawing/sanding the gearbox down to fit only the gears I needed.. warning- be careful if you test the gears with a battery.. the fisher price is pretty darn fast, we toned it down to 600 rpm for a certain mechanism but upon testing it with a battery this mechanism *flew* out and hit our 12+ foot high ceiling :P

Read the rest of the thread. :rolleyes:
This is an update on my previous question:

On the van door motor and the seat door there is a connector. I could not find the female connector for either of these motors. Is it legal in the competition to have the connector cut off and directly wire it to the circuit breaker?
Could someone please address how rule 5.3.2.2 would apply to this situation? Joel brought up this concern earlier... I haven't seen a response from either team. I'm just curious about the billing rate that's appropriate.

461 has always used $50 / hr for any CNC work we've had done, but I don't know a fair rate for a typical machinist.

I'm just curious how this will all pan out... it'll be interesting to say the least. I'm not nearly as concerned about having two identical designs as I am about the whole idea of, "I'll build two of this and you build two of that, and we'll switch." It's much faster to build 2 of 1 part than 1 of 2 parts.

I know at Purdue, discussions over homework assignments is encouraged. However, writting out problem #1 twice, and having a friend write out problem #2 twice, followed by a switch of assignements doesn't fully teach either party the material in the problem they didn't do. In my mind, this homework example parallels this collaboration somewhat close.

However, I'm a little divided to be honest. It seems like this is taking something a bit too far. What that "something" is... I can't place my finger on... so apon the fence I sit, watching it unravel.

Good luck to everybody!

With the arms down, and the claw down we are able to push the balls trough the field, and obviously push the movable goal. (I hope, just kidding  :D ). Soon we will post a link with a video so you guys can see it in action, and maybe help us finding another functions  :)
It's not just the machining time.  The real biggie is the design work.  What do you think it would cost on the open market to hire an engineering firm to design an arm that satisfies all of the applicable constraints and fulfils all of the applicable functional requirements?  I doubt it could be done for less than $3500, and that's just to get it designed!

That having been said, I have no problem with this concept as long as the financials are straight.  Any team can hire outside engineering and machining.  That's exactly what's happened here w/ 60 and 254.  They just happened to negotiate a really outstanding price.  The $3500 limit keeps it fair.


How many teams have their freshmen/ 1st year attendee(rookie) make buttons before other team members? or hows your method of button making?




Well on team 126 we have a button design contest, and our team members vote on the best design. Then, our spirit team leader Tia with help of other team members make buttons  :D

Looks like clay to me. "Empty Bowls" maybe?


A few things I saw after glancing at it:


if (armcounter = 15) //will raise arm.
pwm06=0;
else
armcounter++;
pwm06=255;


sould be


if (armcounter == 15) //will raise arm.
pwm06=0;
else {
armcounter++;
pwm06=255;
}



It is VERY rare that you'll actually want to use a single = in an if, so watch out for that, and also be careful with your curly braces.

That said, I believe the code in its original form should have printf'd 15 over and over and over.  Was it doing that, or just not printing anything?




remember that you need to add the curly braces, not just change the equals sign to a double-equals. w/o the braces, the code is equivalent to this:



if (armcounter == 15) //will raise arm.
pwm06=0;
else {
armcounter++;
}

pwm06=255;



note how pwm06 will always end up as 255, no matter what the value is.

you said that the "motors weren't stopping" - of course they aren't: 0 is full reverse, 255 is full forward. if you want a motor to stop, set the PWM to 127.
How long did it take to put that arm together?  My team has a similiar idea, but we haven't started, I would like to get a timetable

I enjoy the fact that you guys reach out to other teams for scouting.

I just wish some of your members would become more familiar with the CD message board's options before randomly posting "I need someone from 229 IMMEDIATELY!"  (okay bad example -- no one would ever want 229... ;))

I didn't mean to offend.

First of all, I would say that laser pointers are illegal to use on your robot. When used as a site, they couldn't count as a non functional decoration. And, since they conduct electricity, you would have to build them out of parts from one of the approved electronics suppliers.

Furthermore, I would guess that laser pointers would be disallowed completely due to the risk of eye injury. Last year, the real time scoring operators squatted along side the field, probably at about the level you would be pointing the laser at.

This is a question for FIRST Q/A, though.


OK the problem that we been having is that we  can't make the autonomus period for the robot, we put one of the programs we made on users routine fast but it doesn't work please if you could tell us were to put or what do we need to make it work because the program does not work please help.   :confused:  :confused:  :confused:




have you tried adding a printf statement into the code to see if the program is even running? if you are putting the autonomous code into the User_Autonomous_Code() function (and you should be), it won't run unless you enabled autonomous mode on the competition port.
basically you would have to wire a current regulator or voltage detector for each battery.

so there isnt really that much of the charger that would be common to all the batteries it is charging.

How long did it take to put that arm together?  My team has a similiar idea, but we haven't started, I would like to get a timetable





If you haven't started.. explore other options, unless you are willing to stay at your shop all day every day until shipping, a ladder system takes quite a while, as there are several separate sections that must fit together perfectly.. we had one a few years ago, it worked perfectly until someone flipped us in our own competition and the entire thing snapped
We took almost one week to build the elevator (including time to buy the materials, the bulding itself, adjusts, strenght tests...). The major issue was when we found out that we had to stretch the chain to work better. To build the claw we took another 3 days, the major issue that time was to put the elevator and the claw togheter.  :D Anything else we can help?




Here is the nub of my concern:  What would people think of all 16 Delphi teams having the machine that the Chief Delphi Team is making this year (or the Delphi Knights, or the TechnoKats, or whatever)?

CEO's love to have winning teams.  We all (including CEO's) know that there is a huge luck factor in winning the Championship.  Having 16 chances to win is better than having just one.

I worry that the pressure to win may increase if this type of collaboration becomes more common -- up to this point, we have always been able to say that TOO close of coordination was out of the bounds of fairness... ...but perhaps not.

Beyond this, I am not sure that it is good for FIRST to have 16 Chief Delphi robots out in the wild ;-)

It could be a strange new world we are entering.

Joe J.





1. Do you think you could build 16 identical robots with 16 teams?

2. This collaboration has everything to do with winning. We will have won before the first regional begins by learning how to work together in a long distance partnership by paving the way for teams to think out side the box, sharing information to help everyone.

Winning a Regional or the National Championship is nice but it doesn’t compare to working as a team to develop a new process to build a better product.

How many teams are willing to share all of there current years ideas to include drawings pictures discussion anything? Team 60 and 254 will and do.

3. Do you think it is easier for two teams to build the same robot or each building their own? The answer is it is much harder to build identical robots.

You have to take your ego and put it on the shelf. You have to listen more than you talk. You must be willing to compromise, only if you use the best of everyone’s ideas will the project be a success. In our case we had to deal with shipping and a lag in getting the parts you needed. There are many other obstacles to over come as well.

Will we have a better product in the end? We hope so.

Have our teams learned some valuable real life lessons? Absolutely!
Teams 60 and 254 collaborating? Amazing idea, whoever thought up that idea deserves much kudos.

Seriously, if I happen to be at a regional where either (or both) teams 60 and 254 are, I will give everybody on those team one cookie. (or a prize of equal value)

This is an excellent idea, and if FIRST indicates it is happy with partnerships like this, I hope to see more of these in the future. The idea that two teams, who compete with each other, are willing to help each other not only with little bits of ideas and advice, but by forming a full-fledged alliance, is excellent. This should be plastered somewhere in an introduction video.

So anyway, what do you guys on 60 and 254 think of Oreos?
wow. silly me, i thought we had to use the right-hand only joysticks

I believe that's a top view of a paint can in which the paint has started to solidify. And for extra bonus points I'm going out on a limb to say they were or were attempting to use that paint on their shipping crate.

this is somewhat off topic

but how exactly are teams mounting the lights?

I glanced at them tonight, and i didn't see any easy way to attach them?

should we just epoxy them or did i miss some kind of mounting hole?




Well we used a little L bracket and some velcro. Well can not find a picture of it on our website ill tell them to upload it 2morrow or something. The URL is

I can't say that I am total against or for this idea. It's just another way for people to build/think. If this how teams really want their robot to be made then by all means go for it.

However, I won't be surprised if there is some type of restriction or ban on this for later years.

This is after I bring up IFI and browse for the .hex I want.  It happens with any program, even ones I havent touched.  Anyone know what this means and how to fix it?
That is very cool.

Are you going to be able to take a ball up with you when you hang?
I have mixed feelings about this. I see how it builds relationships and everything, but you already had a great relationship. This is taking it to a whole new level.

However, I feel that this is unfair to a lot of teams. Splitting up the work between two teams who do not have any trouble with resources is just not right. My team would kill to have the resources your teams have. I think this is just limiting creativity and making FIRST a little more sterile.
You forgot the coffee! You do realize there are a small percentage of people out there (including myself) who hate Mountain Dew. Yeh, Yeh, Yeh, I know we are in the minority. :rolleyes:

Awesome work!!! I’m thrilled to see this actually happen.  In the real world companies will in fact work together on projects to make something bigger and better.  I’m sure this experience inspired your students and hopefully everyone in FIRST will be inspired too.  There is nothing ungracious or there is no cheating here.  The only thing that is unprofessional and ungracious that I've seen while reading this thread is the people that go and bash these two quality and great teams as cheaters and ungracious.  What they did might have been a little unpractical and surprising, but it's not cheating.  Remember Galileo's ideas were bashed by the public when they were first released, but they are now widely accepted for the most part.  Nobody is stopping any of you from trying this, so why don't you go and try it yourself before you judge.  It could be a good learning experience.  Congrats to 254 and 60 on their nice work and I hope to compete along side or against you in Atlanta.

Set the team number on the OI using the dips switches. Then connect the OI  to the RC using the tether cable.   The team number will now be set on the RC

Hmm, in one of the other IFI loader threads, this problem was caused because the COM port was incorrect.  Have you checked that?
any normal polygon can have a radius,  but most people only think of circles.   The radius of a square, or any other nprmal polygon is the distance from it's 'center' to one of it's corners.
Looks very nice.

Did you guys make that in Flash or are you allowed to reveal your secrets. ;)
If it's anything like last year's rules, no.  I think they said that you could not bring anything on the field with you to assist in aligning the robot for the beginning of the match, and I think that using it as a sight for pre-match placement counts.
My one and only qualm is about how this will work with the $3,500 limit.

1. There has obviously been some machining done by other teams.

2. This machining needs to be billed out at a reasonable cost.

I don't see how it can be honestly billed out at a reasonable rate to both teams, and stay within the $3,500 limit.


If it can be done within the rules, I'm all for it.

However, simple algebra says that any reasonable amount of outside machining time at a reasonable (or even very generous) rate will add up to tens of thousands of dollars very quickly.

I don't see how it can be done, but I sincerely hope that I'll be proved wrong. I hate to say it, but I think we're going to need an official ruling on this from FIRST. I'd assume that someone from one of the teams has already asked FIRST about it before venturing too far.

What ruling did they give you?

If you haven't asked... I propose this goes up on the Q&A in section 5.3

Good luck everyone!

Matt


Hey guys! Just posting for some help with C. We have the IR code and alternative code done and they are working fine but how do we set a button or something to press o nthe joystick to switch to manual, or will the judges send out a signal to the bots changing it fro mmanual to autonomous or what? The whole transition is rather confusing to me, wow, I sound like a comp[lete n00b. Anywayz, thanks guys.


The software that controls the matchs automatically switch from auton mode to manual control mode.  You will not be able to control that switch in competition  but you can create a dongle to activate auton for practice sessions.  To do so, search for the yellow dongle white paper on here (i think).[/quote]

<div style="display:none;">
(images go here)

I'm somewhat confused by your question. The pressure switch that FIRST supplys us with automatically turns the compressor off when the system reaches 120 psi, but turns it on when it drops below that or reaches 60 (might be off on that #) psi in the system. Possibly if you re-word your question I can give a better answer/explanation.
mmm, big ol' flash thing.
Hi!
We are a rookie team, and we also have a few questions.
One: We tried a Microsoft Sidewinder Precicison Pro, and it did not seem to work. Any thoughts about this?
Two: What brand are the included joysticks and where can you get them?

Thanks!!!

I have a question for the electrical wizards out there. How would a charging system be properly designed to charge multiple batteries at one? I would think a nicely setup diode layout would prevent one battery trying to charge another, even if there was a chance for something like that.




There are ways Venkatesh...
Actually there are a number of multiple battery charger for all kinds of applications.  They generally use a common power supply and then branch out to fedd each battery through it's own charge circuit.  You want the charger to constantly check the state of charge the battery vitals and generally even the temperature of the individual batteries.  I know that Motorola has eight wide charging stands for walkietalkies.  These chargers give indications of the state of charge on each battery and can even flag batteries that are about to die.  Some multi chargers are actually computer controlled devices that can produce a series of tests and give printed reports of battery by serial number.
Very nice color scheme you guys have chosen. One suggestion, on the left navigation bar, possibly when you roll over a link, you can make the background a  different color? This may just be a personal preference of mine, but I don't personally like a navigation bar where you have to wait for the little hand to appear  :D


Is anyone else getting this message on Streamline:




I'm experiencing that same problem.  It seems like there's too many large scanned images sitting in the upload folder.  Perhaps we can email the forms somewhere? :ahh:
You can use any joystick to your heart's content as far as the rules go. However, if I remember, the ports on the robot controller are 15 pin (might be wrong). So any joystick that is a USB interface and such will need an adapter or be re-wired to work with the OI.


To do so, search for the yellow dongle white paper on here (i think).




Unfortunately,the yellow dongle white paper was written in 2001, before we had autonomous, so that isn't included. It also shows an LED connected to pin 1, which will void your warranty.

The schematic that shows the autonomous switch is availible from innovation first: http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/Competition_Port_Pinout_Guide.PDF However, when I build it, I generally do not include SW3, I just short pin 12 to ground (8)
You know, I'll put 'my ego on the shelf' and just say lets lock this thread. It's going to get ulgy, and it's already happening. It's best for all parties involved just to lock this thread. This is going to be collusion all over again.
FIRST does not specify when the compressor must be on or off - you could run it for all 2 minutes as far as they care.  It's all about saving the motor in it and the battery.  So, yes that would be acceptable.
He wants to know if he can manually turn the compressor on, or can the compressor only come on when the pressure sensor senses low pressure.

Based on my reading of the rules, my first inclination would be to say no based on &lt;R54&gt;. However, why would FIRST give you a second pressure sensor if it couldn't be used for making decisions about the compressor? You should ask in the FIRST Q/A.
Hokie4Life is exactly right in that the robot isn't everything. Some teams including ours is run as a business and the robot is only a small part of it. I suggest you go to the comps if possible, even if you don't compete, just to see other robots up close, ask questions of the teams, and get ideas and learn from your mistakes. Also learning the concept of Gracious Professionalism is important also. There was a team at the NYC regionals about two years ago that lost all thier mentors and the students showed up with a nonfunctional, partially built robot. Our team, when not competing, went over to their pit and built them a semifunctional robot which gave them a chance to get on the field with. They were clueless and basically watched us and learned. I don't know their team number off hand but I believe it was in the 700's and we will never forget them and they will never forget us, team 237. That was GP at it's best. I can't guarantee that will happen to you but no matter how bad things look their's always a brighter side and the possibility to learn.

P.S. If anyone from that team is out there drop us a line and let us know how you're doing.

He's using some CSS which would download the images, but not display them. In the section where it says, images go here, you would put &lt;img&gt; tags for each of the images. The browser would download them as part of loading the page, and when you go to rollover the images, they would already be downloaded, and display instantly.

Chris,

I seriously doubt that it is a 14 DP.  It is almost certainly 20 deg pressure angle.

What is the OD?  To first order, the OD is (2+Nteeth)/DP  Does this match up.

I confess that I don't have the gear in hand so I can  only advise.

From talking to the folks at Fisher Price (several years ago, when I was explaining FIRST and begging them to donate motors/gearboxes) I am fairly sure it is an English gear, that it is not modified (enlarged) and that it is a standard 20 degree pressure angle gear.  But... ...time passes, perhaps they have gone more exotic designs.

I wish I had more for you.

Joe J.




Dr Joe

I don't have one here with me either and I left my notes at home. The driving gear has 17 teeth and the pitch diameter is 1.2" + or - .030", with the tools at hand I couldn't get finer than that. I figured that out by sliding the gears around to where the mating surface was directly between the gear centers and measuring with a caliper to the estimated contact point. Since the gear has an odd number of teeth, measuring the OD is a bit of a challenge. I suppose our shop could figure it out with their CMM if I brought one over there by touching three points and letting the computer do the rest. But I will probably just check using the formula above and see which comes closest to, but slightly over the measured diameter

From what I remember, your formula did give a reasonable answer using 14 pitch, but the answer using 13 and 15 was obviously either too big or too small. Fortunately, pitches are most always integer numbers

For now I'll assume 14 pitch with a 20deg pressure angle.  My attempted measurements came close to that number, but the teeth are so triangular looking I thought it must be more. My measurements also had a large variability so I didn't want to rely on them. I still need to talk to our controls guys and find out just what diameter we are going to use. There is some internal debate going on about whether it is better to have the encoder make multiple turns or something less than one. That is a subject out my area, so it will be a day or two before I can design the gear anyway.

Edit&gt;&gt; Upon reaching home, I checked my notes. The gear I measured was 1.25 max diameter with no allowance  for the caliper jaw resting across two teeth. Plugging this into the formula above gives a DP of 15.2. Rearrainging and using 15 as the DP the formula gives an OD of 1.266. Pretty close to and slightly over what I measured. Too close for it to be anything else.

So Dr Joe, at the moment it looks like I owe you one BeachBot's special encoder gear. Should I send it when it's done or should I just hand it to you at Nationals? &lt;&lt;Edit


He wants to know if he can manually turn the compressor on, or can the compressor only come on when the pressure sensor senses low pressure.

Based on my reading of the rules, my first inclination would be to say no based on &lt;R54&gt;. However, why would FIRST give you a second pressure sensor if it couldn't be used for making decisions about the compressor? You should ask in the FIRST Q/A.




The pressure switch is made to turn on at any pressure below 90psi and off at 120psi.  You still need to program it and i think that there is a way to code the switch to have a second state in which if a secondary switch (controlled by you) is on, the pump goes on and shuts off still @ 120psi.
That's what I thought he meant when he asked his question. I just find it odd that someone would want to manually turn a compressor on when the pressure switch does it for you. Experience has shown my team, that having the compressor constantly running will dramatically drain the battery, which is why FIRST supplies the pressure switch. Just make sure that there is no leaks so the compressor isn't on all the time.

P.S.- It's also a good idea to charge your system before a match. Have an extra battery for turning the compressor on to charge up your system, so the compressor doesn't run during autonomous :)
You're all wrong...

It's got to be pudding.   :)
I'll point out that she's talking about using the laser pointer as a sighting mechanism to line up the robot properly before the match.  I honestly have no clue as to the legality of this.  I don't think sighting mechanisms, positioning jigs, etc. are covered at all by FIRST in the rules or on the Q&A.  Atleast I haven't seen anything.  I'll go with ToMMan and say that if you take it with you I wouldn't see a problem.  Just machine some sort of cradle on the robot to hold it in while you're sighting.

I'd say both of these are good FIRST Q&A candidates.  Ask your original question, and then ask if it is legal to use it ask a sighting mechanism while setting the robot on the field, and then remove it and take it with you.
Nah, whoever was writing Chairmans suddenly lost their lunch. yep.

We had this discussion (well, not really a discussion, but a comment) in another thread. http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=217459&postcount=19

depending on how you are doing it, you may need to make your own macros.


Is it legal a laser pointer be fixed to the robot as a site, and be turned off once the match has commenced?




If you do indeed want to use it to line up your robot, here's another alternative that works great. Just grab a sharpie, align it properly on a practice field, and draw a dark black line right above where the white tape is. Worked great for us last year, we never once missed the bins throughout all 3 of our competitions (gyro-based also, but proper placement was critical)
It's official, you're only allowed one compressor on the robot. I had the question posted to FIRST to get a definite answer and they responded.
Maybe I was unclear when i described the work done by each team in my previous post. Although Team 60 and 254 each *machined* half of the robot, both teams worked together in forming a single design that satisfied everyone, not "we make one part, you make the other, then we'll stick em together". It took us over 1/3 of the build season to finally come up with the design that united the interests of both teams.

Collaboration may make some facets of the program easier, but it brings out unique challenges as well.

This type of collaboration does not decrease competition at all. It is highly unlikely that both 60 and 254 will be in the same division at Nats (though we would enjoy working with them), so wouldn't a match between our teams become extremely competitive, coming down to driver skill and strategy? There are so many other factors other than robot design that can come into play.

Locking this thread would deprive everyone from finding more about our partnership, and both Team 60 and 254 are happy to keep providing information.
If you have a 2" bore, 24" stroke piston, you are going to want to make sure there is more then 90 PSI in the system before you fire. That is why you would want to run the pump before the sensor normally would.

There are many ways you "could" program the system, but my question is whether &lt;R54&gt; allows that.
1/16

Nasa gave it to us, they say its special or something?
Along that line of thought, you could also make a ring-pin gunsight kind of thing as well.

If this forum is as amazing as I think it is, I think it can handle some intelligent discussion about a new idea that's never been done before at this level.

Putting aside all the messages that's saying "this is cheating and unfair", I think there are some important points from both side.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that at this point on none of you get emotional about this topic, IF you want to have a constructive discussion about this.  Do NOT let your emotion take control of you.  Think for 15 mins before you post.

Now.  Important points from each side:

1.  By working together both teams have learned something they never would've if they worked alone, and that is, the values of partnership, and learning to work with a new process.

2.  It is not as easy as you think to design a robot together.

On the other hand:

1.  Joe J. addressed his concern of many powerful teams working may tilt the playing field in their favor.

2.  Matt Adams addressed his concern of this collaboration with the spirit of the $3500 limit rule.


There are probably more important points, so remind us of your points if you wish to address your concern further.

Now, let's build a good discussion on top of those sides.  I ask that everyone read the entire thread before they post.  I will be watching out for messages that claim "I didn't have time to read the message but I feel like posting anyway".

I will be truly disappointed if you guys can't handle a constructive discussion in the most intense time of the build period.

5.3.2.2 Cost Determination
"If the machine shop were part of the team, its labor cost would not apply."


Laron Engineering, the machine shop that sponsors Kingman, is also part of our team.


"Shipping costs of Non-Kit items are not counted."

Our shipping costs between the two teams are not counted.
I think this is a valid discussion, so just keep it calm :)
like what should we talk about?
At first sight I became rather angry, because hey, it just didnt seem fair. Two elite teams combining. Most teams didn't even make a robot that could stay with their previous bots, and here they are sharing their expertise. It's just plain unfair..

Then when i tried to derive all of the reasons why this is uncool I suddenly hit a rut- there are none, other than the point that they're already 2 elite teams colloborating. And it's not like they live next door to eachother, its pretty far away.. How did you guys do it? video conferences? I'm dying to know.

I bet FIRST bans this kind of interaction soon in the future, or at least limits it. Why? I can just see several powerhouses building undefeatable robots, and then the finals at the Championship Event yielding several look-alikes. This is not what FIRST is about. A single function, maybe, but not an entire robot. (yea, i know there are several differences, but basically the two bots are twins)



It also dissapoints me somewhat. I always look forward to seeing what the oldest teams have made. But now there's one less robot to look forward to.
The team list, from FIRST's website:
http://www.usfirst.org/frc/map/FMPro?-db=team%20events.fp5&-lay=web&-format=team_list.htm&event=MO&event%20year=2004&status=signed%20up&-sortfield=team%20id&-max=all&-find
This thread is to be used solely for technical discussion about Team 254's robot. Please post robot-related questions here...there is a separate thread for team collaboration in the general forum.
can you guys go up the 6in step with them?
ok... say we made something like a little channel on our robot for the laser pointer.  Could we like, align the robot to where it needs to be w/ the pointer in the set-up for the match, BEFORE the match even starts.  Then after we're all set... remove the laser pointer?


have you tried adding a printf statement into the code to see if the program is even running? if you are putting the autonomous code into the User_Autonomous_Code() function (and you should be), it won't run unless you enabled autonomous mode on the competition port.




we do have a printf and it does read but the program for the sensors does not work we are rookies and it is the first time we use C so not much expirience :D  :D so please can you guide us trow step by step how to enter the code please.
psssst, i think those fins on the top are for some kind of hovercraft/sail design :)

Matt,

Sometimes it's hard to determine who is a sponsor and who is not, especially as far as this rule goes. However, Laron Engineering is not listed as a sponsor for your team, currently. Your sponsors, according to FIRST, are NASA Ames Research Center, Unity Care Group, and Line-X. Your website isn't working right now, but before it went down, it didn't have any mention of Laron Engineering either. Thus, I think that you would have a hard time proving that Laron is a sponsor.

Needless to say, I'm quite excited about the opportunities that this afforded the two teams.
I've got the same problem as well. Just wondering what you plan on doing about it. I'm sure it's happening to a lot of people but would you still suggest sending an email to autodesk about it.
I would also like to know if it is acceptable to manually turn the compressor off.
Once again, hats off to 60 and 254 for an excellent idea.

I have seen people find objections to having cooperation of this kind between teams. People were talking about how unfair FIRST would be if there were alliances of great teams, creating robots which would be unbeatable. People have also mentioned the fact that both teams will have done only "half the work".

I will speak now from experience. Building a robot is child's play compared to creating a consensus between people. Especially smart people who know how to create things, know what they are capable of. It has been said that invention is a human art, compromise a divine one. Pride in ideas is a very remarkable factor, as are logistics. If 60 and 254 were able to make sure nobody was silenced during the creation of this alliance, then all power to them. Especially to those who were directly behind this idea - does becoming a diplomat sound like a good career?

There is no such thing as an unbeatable robot. Teams with experience and resources will seem invincible to those who don't have the same resources. It has been said that FIRST isn't fair. I think that statement itself is unnecessary. If FIRST was a competetion of equals, where would the motivation to build an incredibly slick robot come from? I wasn't at many competetions last year, but 25's robot (at J&J) sticks out in my mind as having been very well done. If all the robots present were of equal calibre, strategy and teams would be unnecessary. And just look at 25 at PARC. They  were not invincible, just very good.

I know that sometimes alliances between competetors can create improper situations. However I have enough trust in all of the students, mentors, etc. participating in FIRST to recognize such problems and ward them off. After all,   bitterness takes all the fun out of wiring.
I'm strangley suspecting to see Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Butters, Kenny, and the entire South Park cast show up in your animation this year hehe.
that might be an issue. Last year, we made a wooden triangle to align our bot with the side of the ramp so it would run smoothly in auto mode. This didn't fly with the judges tho, and we weren't allowed to use it. If it is simple to make what you want, I'd say go for it, but it is more than likely the judges will make you stop.
It would be my interpretation that is would be perfectly legal.  IMHO the preople on these forums seem to like to shun that which they have not seen before or which in not commonplace, or is not specifically specified to be legla.  Look at the intention of the rules.  Somebody at the kickoff said somethign about not being lawyers here.  Use your common sense people.  Its not all that hard.
WOW!
That looks really neat. But, and this is critical, that arm is huge and the base is small. I don't know about the weight of that giant beasty arm, but that thing with the right leverage could tip.:-(
So a few questions I would like answered are:
1. How much does the arm weigh?
2. Have you tried it out, driving with it on, etc.?
3. On the happier note, is that a turntable? If it is, that's great.
I had so much trouble with this!  I hope it worked out for you guys.  As for me, I got the document in within a few minutes of the deadline.  :eek:
My team is having the same problem.  Anyone find any solutions?
Interesting, very interesting. I'm judging by the lip on the front, you're gonna try to hang by the bar. If so, have you tried climbing the steps? It looks as if your center of gravity might effect it with that arm looking very heavy.
what time was the deadline?
I think it was today, before 8 am pacific time.  If I was wrong, someone correct me.

The actual animation wasn't due today, just the necessary forms.
This is indeed a problem. Unfortunately it was likely caused by abuse and missuse of the system. There are many teams that have submitted several copies of the same application and there are also people who have uploaded their storyboards (to the wrong directory even, let alone at the wrong time).

I have contacted Autodesk technical support, which in itself was an interesting endeavour seeing as how today is a holiday in the United States, and have been informed that there is nothing they can do about this situation. It is completely in the hands of the administrators of the account.

Our main concern now is certainly finding out who is the administrator of the account and if the submition date will be extended at least for another few days.


Roberto Alencar

P.S.: Autodesk technical support has had several calls about this issue and they are constantly repeating what I have said above. I was asked to provide them with the name and email of the administrator for the streamline account so that they can inform whoever calls them. If you know this information, send it to [email]bcs.support@autodesk.com[/email]. Do post here to let us know that this information has already been sent so we dont swamp Autodesk with superfluous emails.

P.P.S.: I do not represent Autodesk technical support. All the information I was able to gather in my attempts to solve this problem are in this post.
Nice pulley or winch. The device has a good chance of working, depending on the stress put on the wire.
I am experiencing the same problem, has FIRST posted anything on this matter? :S the deadline wasnt at 8 am, the form just said the paper work is due monday, february 16. there was no time specified
Would i say it's better to mount everything to a board? **NO**
well then again, we have a wood base.
Yes. It becoms simple when you realize that a circle is naught but a polygon with infinite sides. Remember approximating PI in 9th grade  :rolleyes:
Well this is a side view of our frame if youlook up top those big sprocket is our arm and then you can see the cim sticking out  and as you look around we have hubs on our wheels those work very specific way
Personally, I think an insulating surface is better for electronics - there is less of a risk of a short if a wire falls off. That being said, aluminum is stronger than plexiglas and most other insulating surfaces.

As for easily detachable... Yes, it is definitely a good idea to make all wires as accessible as possible. A detachable panel may be a good thing.

Velcro, in my opinion, is a very bad idea. It is not strong enough for what the bot will have to endure during the match. If the velcro falls off, so does your RC/speed controller, then the wires are going to be ripped off, and you'll short the battery. Definitely not a good idea :D

Motors and fuses going bad... It could happen, but it did not to our team. You can check fuses with an ohmmeter to see if they are ok. As for motors... You can bring spares if you want (it would be the best thing to do), but if you cant get spare motors, FIRST should have a limited supply at the competitions.

The motors should not get hot if your gear ratios are right. If they do get hot, a fan will not solve the problem. There was already a thread about this.

Of course, anything could go wrong at any time :D Just do your best to avoid obvious mistakes.
Looks good, now I see where those wheel modules come in. How much does it weight and how fast is it?


a couple questions from a rookie team..






Much less can go wrong from uninsulated wires and connectors if they can't touch something big and conductive



is it better to have them mounted on a board that is easily deattachable from the robot?




I can see the advantage of this, but in 8 years I've never felt it was worth the time to do so. Especially since you are this late in the season, I wouldn't try.



is using velcro to mount each individual component a good idea?




Personally, I like bolting them down better. However, This year, about half our components are velcroed down. When used in large quanties, velcro is quite strong on a horizontal surface. I wouldn't put it on the edge of mounted vertically with velcro, though.



is it not a good idea to mount them to our frame directly using velcro?(our frame is aluminum)




see above about mounting to a conductive surface. Also, if it is on the exterior, I'd be worried about other robots running into you.



how easily accessible should they be?




Seeing that you are a rookie team, you more then likely will have electrical problems that need to be solved quickly. They don't need to be in open air, but it also shouldn't take more then a minute or two to get to them. You also shouldn't have to pull an contortions to work on them.



is it a bad idea to need to flip the robot over to take out the battery?




the battery has to be easily accessible, per the rules. You also have to demontstrate this to the inspectors. I do not beleive this meets that criteria.



has there been any accidents that you know of where any part excluding the motors and fuses had to be replaced completely due to any reason other than physical disturbances?




If you get metal in the speed controllers, they will release the magic smoke.



how what gets HOT? the motors..... the victors? well they already have fans on them...




That's pretty much it.[/quote]


**is it better to have them mounted on a board that is easily deattachable from the robot?**- Yes. If you add a new motor or component you won't want to bend over the robot for 10 minutes shifting wires-



how? a couple bolts?




**is using velcro to mount each individual component a good idea?**-NO! a direct hit could knock something off, imagine losing your entire left drivetrain thanks to a collision-



again, how? i don't think glue'll work. or wait *were* there hole for bolts on each one?




**is it a bad idea to need to flip the robot over to take out the battery?** Um.. yes... flipping over 130 pounds of metal isn't pleasant, and in the playoffs you'll have to replace it often-



or how about crawling under and replacing? i don't know how big the pit area is... well, our robot is quite high off the ground and it might be nice to have more weight below than above. not worried itll flip or anything but just MIGHT be better


Wish I knew your supplier - we got ours at Summit Racing for $14.  It's built well, though.

Nah, whoever was writing Chairmans suddenly lost their lunch. yep.



lol even I had to ask Marygrace what this was, and I'M the main person writing the chairman's paper!
Um....I can't really say what it is or it refers to, but some of you are pretty close. :)
each wheel module weighs about 6 lbs, we haven't done an exact weight of the bot since not all the stuff is on there yet, but we expect to be bumping right up against 130lbs. We should be moving at around 7-9fps.
What size and wall thickness is your frame material?
Well, here it is!  Few things to say first:

#1) I previously said that we were building gearboxes, and you might notice that we are using the drill gearboxes.  Well we have basically scrapped the custom gearbox idea because our flange berrings were very stiff, and our tests showed that one berring drew 5 amps.

#2) This isn't the whole bot, there are going to be a few additions. (pics soon)
One prog name we're gonna have(and code before the comp) is "boogie down"
1/16
Why such large sprockets?  Also, what size and wall thickess is your frame material?
1" x1" tubing and the wall thickness is 1/16" in most places, but thicker in some places where it needs to be stronger. In some places we reinforced the frame by putting angle iron or plating it (i.e. where the pillow blocks for the wheels are)
Right now I have Bloodlined Calligraphy in my player, they're a local metal group.
Our drive train is powered by 2 Atwoods and 2 drill motors, with 2 speeds, pneumatically shifted. The gearbox is a modification of 60's design from 2001. The 6-wheeled base is modeled after Team 25's awesomely fast and agile machine from 2003, with the center wheel on each side lower than the others by 1/8 inch, so that the robot rocks back and forth. This shrinks our wheelbase to about 13", allowing us to turn quickly.

The numerous solenoids on our bot are actually used for many different functions. One is for the cylinders that shift our gears, two are for our ball corralling "flaps", one extends our bar-grabbing hook, one actuates our gripping hook for latching onto the mobile goals, one extend the "whips" that knock off the 10-pt balls, one double solenoid actuates the claw for manipulating the large balls, and the other double solenoid engages and disengages the winch for pulling ourselves onto the bar.
1. Is it really BETTER to have them mounted on a non insulating surface?

This year, we constructed our electronics "deck" to be removable from the robot, so a board made sense. If you are careful with your wiring, you don't need a board at all. It has made things easier for us, though.

2. Is it better to have them mounted on a board that is easily deattachable from the robot?

In the hectic scene of the pits, will you have time to remove a deck, check wiring, check code, recheck wiring, and recheck wiring again, and then reinstall the board? Remember the number of devices that much be connected. We tried using terminal blocks to keep all the wire that interfaced the board with the 'bot separate, but our board ended up affixed.

3. Is using velcro to mount each individual component a good idea?

Honestly, I wouldn't trust velcro for components so critical. However, if you are able to construct stable mounts with velcro, and happen to have spare components, go for it. Velcro knots and meshes might be strong enough.

4. How easily accessible should they be?

Anything that can go wrong will. Robots that should move won't. Robots that shouldn't, will. Speed controllers will explode, resembling small atomic bombs (really), relays will jam, etc. Accessible components are a good idea.

5. Is it a bad idea to need to flip the robot over to take out the battery?

Can you (1 person) change a battery in an emergency in under 2 minutes? If so, good. Personally, I like to have the battery as accessible as possible, especially if a robot frame is aluminium. In the off chance of a short, you can do something. However careful wiring can eliminate that problem.

6. Has there been any accidents that you know of where any part excluding the motors and fuses had to be replaced completely due to any reason other than physical disturbances?

We have had speed controllers (victor 883s) which appeared to work, but the electrolyte in the capacitor had dried up, and they didn't actually power the motors. We have never had problems with relays, spike red or blue. In fact, we have never even blown a fuse on the relays. Our main problems have been more physically oriented (physical damage, etc).

7. how what gets HOT? the motors..... the victors? well they already have fans on them...

The victors get hot, but not very hot. I believe that the Victors act like the Tekin Rebels, generating the greatest heat at low speeds. I'll have to check that sometime. Motors (especially the drill) get very hot after significant run times. Last year, we had a drill motor reach a temperature where they were far too hot to touch, and that was after roughly 10 minutes of running. I personally like to cool them, but I don't see too many robots that do so.
We also tried a  MS Sidewinder, but the 3d pro.  It seemed to center at 80/80 instead of 127/127 for some reason.  Instead, we found a cheap one witha  really good return spring,  that centers w/in 4 or 5.


Our drive train is powered by 2 Atwoods and 2 drill motors, with 2 speeds, pneumatically shifted. The gearbox is a modification of 60's design from 2001.


It must have been a fairly major modification as the drills were different then and we didn't even have Chias.

The above segment is definately going to be in our code. I think we might have the LEAP_FORWARD function contain all the critical code for driving, and have main() call mao(). Something like that.

Another segment from our code so far:

#define TWO 3

Looks great. Everything looks super organized, even down to the different color pneumatic tubes. Good luck this year.


looks like their 2002 robot, methinks.

That is correct, we put 8 speakers, neons, and a spoiler on it for show. We are planning to use it for exhibition and for fund raisers right now since they seem to frown upon motorized boom boxes for carts anymore. The next project may have plans for pnuematic suspension and 13" spinners for last years bot, who knows how far the rice has to go.

Poll is the type of music, list the album, unless you have like a 200 CD changer like some of my friends, and then I don't have time to read that stuff....

Me, I have multiple CD players:

Stereo: Sevendust --&gt; "Seasons"

Cd Player: Linkin Park --&gt; "Hybrid Theory"

I'm both Nu Metal and Rock, but I like Nu Metal the most especially by my logo!! :D[/quote]
I have Staind and Bruce Springstein's Greatest Hits from 95 (I think) playing right now.

I have ACDC playing while I'm Tetrising on my x-box.
it just worked for me :P   :ahh:
Try wrapping a pair (one from each drive train) of tires with something radially.  I understand this is kind of a dumb solution, it makes more sense to just get wheels or tires with the right treads, but its easy, cheap, and quick.

At first we tried 1/16" steel cable, but it wasnt big enough to lift the wheels off the ground.  We probably shoulda have tried again with thicker cable, but that stuff is REALLY tedious to work with (think 100+ ft per pair and something like 130 individual wraps).  So we had some zip tries lying around...  They are excellent at reducing cross-wise friction (it turns on high gear now) but they did take away significantly from traction in the direction we need.  Regardless, we can climb 6 inches with our two drills and 12.5" skyways, so im happy.
Week #6 is hear at last. And I'll be the first to say that im upset to see it go. and not upset at all. So As marking the begining of week #6 how far away are you from 100% completion / already driving / or both. Good Ol 522 is working on the magical design and my lips are sealed.

As far as doing donuts is concerned if thats what your team designed the robot to do ID worry if i were you j/k, otherwise any movement from a robot getting done is a sign of success.

How many teams are done / almost done / done doesn't exist in your teams vocabulary ????
The acount seems to be taking files. If you need to submit anything, now is the time.

Just for people that didnt know what it looked like before...

http://www.chiefdelphi.com/pics/bin/1016055120ridethegoal.jpg
that thing seems like a monster... how much does it weigh!?
Does this work with an EDU-bot?
just wondering, b4 i saw alot of other teams forms, now i only seem a few new posted ones :P?
The robot looks good. The spiral wrap you added was a good addition, really neatens it up. I just want to point out that you might want to add chain tensioners. The one on the left appears to have a bit of slack.
I'm don't like your intro page at all.
The logo is cool, but all the sponsors and FIRST logo make it look cluttered. I also don't think that you need to have the scrolling text along the bottom announcing the shipment date being pushed back.

However, I like the countdown timer. ^_^


build from 9 am to 2:30 am.




i wish my team could have work hours like that then we could eliminate some of the stress about the time we have. we can't have hours like that because our advisor has other comitments and lives about an hour away.


Seriously, all our code is well commented and human readable, except the code in our interrupts




Our code is well commented to.  People have complained in the past that I don't explain my code well enough (non-programming types, so what can you do?), so I've decided to let the Bard do it for me ...

Here are some wonderful (and iambic pentameteric) samples:

Timer interrupt, anyone?
/* When I do count the clock that tells the time */

Auton mode; first drive full speed forward!
/*
O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
When swift extremity can seem but slow?
*/

Encoders and PID control make for some nice driving:
/*
Be where you list, your charter is so strong
That you yourself may privilege your time
To what you will; to you it doth belong
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
*/

For static or global variables:
/*
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
*/

And, in honor of the BASIC stamp of years past, here's the last sample I'll give (afterall, you might reverse engineer my code if I offer too much ;))
/*
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
*/

See, I'm not obsessed with programming.  I do have a literary side!  (And with 154 sonnets, and other poems to boot, you can imagine that this is but a small sample.  W00t!)
you are aloud to use any controller as long as they fit the ports on the controlelr last year we used a steering wheel
:yikes:

That is not our final product! Side panels and painting have yet to commence :yikes:



Hi Brian
Job well done   looks great that bot can take a good hit,     See you soon TJ2 Team 88  and MOE

wow... all those macs.... wow... to bad our school is cheap hahahaha... you all wouldnt mind if i stole one would you!?!?! =D

> the distribution block and ground stud are required for this years robots circuit


Where do you guys see in the rules where it says the ground stud is REQUIRED?

Instead of using the ground lug, we have used the center "phase 2" of the Allen Bradley Distribution block which is more than enough to hold the current in not better than crimp on ring connectors to a ground stud.

However if someone could let me know if I missed something in the rules about the ground stud "required" I'd like to read it again.

PS: Attached is a very quick sketch I did of what I mean. I hope you guys can make heads or tails of it...<br><br>![elec.jpg|605x396](upload://5DWQrUkwmfOkRPvAiXYuA4Qptm4.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![elec.jpg|605x396](upload://5DWQrUkwmfOkRPvAiXYuA4Qptm4.jpeg.jpeg)<br>

how about 884s? i think thats what we are using. also, a red spike and a blue spike? is that the difference in the letters? whats the REAL difference? is one better than another? please explain
Well, i am new on the G-Force team this year, and its just me doing the site. Anyway here is what I came up with http://www.gforce535.com .

us too. never been in school longer than 10am to 8pm.
but FINALLY tomorrow we just might be able to stay in school for a looooooooong time. we need it too!
How often do we talk about how FIRST is about people and not robots?

It's true that a certain amount of balance must exist among teams, but collaborations such as this one are not overpowered.  If you're concerned with teams having an unfair advantage, you should be worried about teams that can have engineers build robots for them.  If teams wanted only to win, there are better and easier ways to do that.  We have to trust that teams will focus on the true goals of FIRST.

It may be possible for 16 teams to all build the same robot, but will that actually happen?  I doubt it.  Personnaly, I trust 60 and 254, and all other teams for that matter, to stay focused on what truly matters.
**beefy.**

very....


like the grinder designs.. thats what you did right?
I tried it but it just doesn't look as good. wonder where im wrong.
maybe if i use even spaces like yours....
helical.. hmm.. looks like its only attached to one wheel also.. so either you guys have the other wheel geared down to match the front or possibly- yes, thats gotta be it, you have the same drivetrain as last year?


what cel shader are you using? I'm working with Cel Filter for Max 3.1, I just need to get a decent palette done.




3ds max 5,6 come with a cel shaded material. the ink doesnt work that well, but you can get it to look good.
i dislike this part


Pictures for 2004 season will come, of course ***after*** the 2004 season.
How bout this:
Replace 2 wheels with omni's...
Probably the rear wheels. This will retain your 4 wheel strength while making your turning much slicker. I also think that with a small chamfer on the front wheels should do the trick.
Teams 60 and 254 are each viewed as powerhouse programs in FIRST -- due largely to that about them which we all see; their well designed robots, their excellent performance, and the testimony of their students.  What challenges they may face are not apparent to those who observe their teams.

It seems to me that this collaboration comes as the result of boredom with and stagnation within their programs.  Perhaps it's precisely that their respective lack of adversity -- in finding sponsorship, technical guidance, or in resolving conflict -- has caused them to seek out additional challenges.  They maintain that this collaboration is more challenging than we might expect.  In fact, it may simply be that they're unfamiliar with the challenges that many other teams face and can't understand that their collaboration is no more difficult than things we've all had to face.

If this is the last frontier remaining for teams 60 and 254 to explore, it may be worthwhile.  If they must create new challenges for themselves so that their programs remain relevant to FIRST, I commend them for having the initiative to take that step.  I am hopeful that this effort has proven worthwhile in inspiring their students to take similar initiative in their own lives, as it does very little to inspire me.  I know that these teams are each, on their own, capable of creating amazing robots -- designed and fabricated with thought and care.  Instead of seeing two such inspiring robots this season, I am left to look at one.  Instead of looking to these teams as beacons of hope when I'm sitting at my computer designing another part; or sitting in the shop waiting to have a part made, I only see that they had someone there to share the workload.  Where I struggle to have access to our single CNC mill, I see that they have twice as many as before.

I'm not against such collaboration, really.  But, that being said, I do not understand why each of these teams did not choose to work so closely with teams that are less fortunate than they are.  Instead of partnering with a rookie team and showing them what FIRST is and can be, they've partnered with a team that knows *exactly* what FIRST is -- just like they do.

I can understand that they see this collaboration as having been a challenge to both teams.  I do not see it as being any more a challenge than myriad things other teams must overcome, nor do I think that it was worthwhile or useful to either team or the larger FIRST community.

Logistically speaking, I'm interested in the response to both Matt and Joel's points regarding the robot's cost limitation and how this shared labor is going to be billed out.   Until they share one team number, they are not one team, regardless of anyone's feelings regarding "extended family."
According to our latest (2/15) progress report, we are roughly 70% complete. We are driving very well now, and have 2 of our 3 subsystems almost complete.
It just has to be in the FIRST TIMS Database by Friday @ Noon.  That is all you have to do, as I understand it.
could you at least tell that you are ripping off FIRST's flash movie thingy somewhere on the site


Nice pulley or winch. The device has a good chance of working, depending on the stress put on the wire.



Such high praise!
Careful, or you might end up actually making a compliment.


188 - Looks awesome guys.  I can't wait to see the finished version.

JVN


EUREKA!!  I think I found the pick-up line that lead to the demise of the FIRST-SME ID cards we used to get!!

"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a Braille name tag."




baaahahaha!! o thats great!
it may get u slapped,
but thats great :yikes:
good luck getting the balls out of there in an orderly fashion.. and oh, did i forget to mention you gotta get them in there first?


None of the robots revealed thusfar have even attempted to contain balls.. I see 2 reasons for this..

1. Those suckers are big and unven. And after a few rounds they'll be donuts.

2. Most of us only have 1 real game ball to test with. You pop it, you're screwed.
Is that actually a computer lab your building your robot in? And I thought it was bad when we build our robot in a hallway and cafeteria. Oh well, I bet I'm not on the only team hoping for our own room or space to call all our own.
but can the one compresser be a custom one? or do you have to use the one in the kit?


how? a couple bolts?


again, how? i don't think glue'll work. or wait *were* there hole for bolts on each one?


or how about crawling under and replacing? i don't know how big the pit area is... well, our robot is quite high off the ground and it might be nice to have more weight below than above. not worried itll flip or anything but just MIGHT be better




For mounting the board- yes, we usually have a lexan board bolted to our robot so whenever something needs to be changed our programmer can whip it out. However, after 'building' season ends, we usually leave it intact.

All of the components should have holes for attaching small bolts.

about crawling under, if you guys make a cart then you shouldn't have to crawl under.. but thats a big if, we didnt even have a cart our first 3 years :/
if you are going to have a compressor on your bot it must be the one supplied by FIRST.

they have allowed us to use commercial vacuum pumps this year, but only for vacuum, not for pneumatics, and the pump must use one of the motors that came in the kit of parts.


Is that actually a computer lab your building your robot in? And I thought it was bad when we build our robot in a hallway and cafeteria. Oh well, I bet I'm not on the only team hoping for our own room or space to call all our own.




we build our robot in our advisors class room. every week night after we finish up we have to pack things up and bring them back down to "the closet" which we share with the foreign language department. weekends are not so bad because we can at least leave the stuff out till sunday night.
I entirely missed &lt;R54&gt;
The wording makes it a bit tricky from a strictly legeal stand point. However with the whole spirit of the game, I think the rule is trying to make sure that you do not hook the pressure sensor directly inline with the compressor.

The pneumatics manual hints at this under the section they designate for the pressure switch. It also says that there is no control in the default program to control the relay so I suppose it goes to say that you can control the relay however you want, just as long as it is done entirely in the code.

That's pretty much the same story with us.  Except out "closet" is three small "rooms" that are just for us.  The place where the picture was taken was the multimedia classroom that is used only M-F 8AM-1:30 PM
If you're using it to line up at startup, I'm not sure.
As for having a pointer on your robot during a match to help align, it should be fine.
Why? Because we did it last year.
Last year we mouned a class 2 laser from radioshack in the center of our bin grabber. It was used to align to the center of a bin. Made it easier for the drivers to see were they were facing. It was a class such that it would not cause eye damage.
It passed inspection, and yes, they did question it, but when our motives were explained, it passed.
Now, we didn't even use it cept for maybe once since we dismantled our stakcer, but I just thought I'd ought to say that there indeed has been an occurence of this passing inspection.
And It didn't directly effect the outcome of the match at all. It simply helped the drivers align with objects on the field.
Did FIRST change the rules about using tape? I dont think you can use velcro tape (sticky on one side) on your robot - you can use velcro belts or loops to hold your battery in - but last time I read the rules the only 'tape' you could use was electical tape, and not to hold things together, only for insultation.
As a second guess that wouldn't have anything by chance to do with "The Spirit Room"? I'll have to say your team really likes to keep other teams in suspense.  Nothing like a good mystery! :p
You didn't try very hard did you dave?  Okay, so U were able to spell vertically.  Really now...
Even a second grader could do that.  For it to be truly innovative, you can't announce it.  I would have thought you could have done better.
Right now however, it's not important.  Eventually, we're going to have a talk about your subliminal writing skills.
Dispicable...

:rolleyes:
**is it really BETTER to have them mounted on a non insulating surface?**
Yes. Last year, our chassis was a sheet of 1/4" aluminum. We mounted the electronics directly to it, and found it very annoying - it increases the likelihood of accidental shorts, and it means that you have to either tape up or remove sensitive components before drilling holes or making modifications. It's more trouble in the long run than simply making a separate electronics board out of non-conductive material.

**is it better to have them mounted on a board that is easily deattachable from the robot?**
That depends on how accessible the board is. If you can reach it easily without having to dig through everything else in the robot, not necessarily. If you can't fix wiring easily with the board installed, then make sure you can detach it quickly.

**is using velcro to mount each individual component a good idea?**
No. The force of bent wires trying to unbend themselves can be sufficient to force components loose from even the heaviest Velcro. We tried this in 2001, and it made a mess. The electronic components all come with holes drilled in them so you can bolt them to things. Use them.

**is it not a good idea to mount them to our frame directly using velcro?(our frame is aluminum)**
Aside from the usual Velcro concerns, doing things this way makes power distribution a nightmare. If you mount your electronics to their own board, you know that you won't end up needing to mount other things to that, and you won't have to rework your wiring all the time when changes are made to other things.

**how easily accessible should they be?**
Obviously, you need to be able to access the main breaker fairly easily. For troubleshooting and maintenance purposes, it's a very good idea to make all the other components as accessible as possible. Last year, our electronics were very poorly organized, making it difficult to troubleshoot problems and repair or replace things when necessary. After that, I made sure to make this year's board as neat and accessible as possible, and it's been a dream to work on so far.

**is it a bad idea to need to flip the robot over to take out the battery?**
Yes. The battery is something that you will want to be able to access very quickly and easily.

**has there been any accidents that you know of where any part excluding the motors and fuses had to be replaced completely due to any reason other than physical disturbances?**
Battery shorts can make wires melt. Victors are always happy to vent their magic smoke. Crimp connections can fail. Assume everything is unreliable until proven otherwise. :P

**how what gets HOT? the motors..... the victors? well they already have fans on them...**
If your gear ratios are good, the motors shouldn't get TOO hot under normal circumstances.  The Victors already have their own fans, but you might want to consider putting additional fans near them if your electronics are enclosed in an area that is not well-ventilated.


Our robot drank it all.



I'd hate to run into your 'bot during competition...anything that craves Mountain Dew is definitely intelligent enough to be dangerous.   :D


Yeah, I don't feel really masculine saying this, but I'm really ticklish.  It's ok at first...then after like a minute or so it starts to get painful.  But for the most part I like it.



Nice to know that I'm not the only ticklish guy out there.   :)

That said...depends on who's tickling.  Definitely helps if they're female...
I decided to let a crazy German run amok in my code this year.. It beats the mute from last year that didn't explain anything at all


void normalize_motors(unsigned char left, unsigned char right) {
// Vait!! Dat's der vrong direction
// -- Inverse the polarity if required
left = (INVERT_LEFT ? 255 - left : left);
right = (INVERT_RIGHT ? 255 - right : right);

// Vut da hell ist up wiv dat der blinkin lighten
// -- Keep the controller from resting by stopping the magic word
left = (left == 255 ? 254 : left);
right = (right == 255 ? 254 : right);

// Vee vill tell das utters vhere vee vent
// -- Keep this information, it may be useful
left_reverse = (left < 127 ? -1 : 1);
right_reverse = (right < 127 ? -1 : 1);

// Und zee motors spin vround und vround
// -- Final output goes to motors
Generate_Pwms( 127, 127, left, right);
LEFT_MOTOR = right;
RIGHT_MOTOR = right;
}

we have a hopper that works great.  we're just not going to post pictures until we get the rest of the robot completed as well.


It's not just the machining time. The real biggie is the design work. What do you think it would cost on the open market to hire an engineering firm to design an arm that satisfies all of the applicable constraints and fulfils all of the applicable functional requirements? I doubt it could be done for less than $3500, and that's just to get it designed!

That having been said, I have no problem with this concept as long as the financials are straight. Any team can hire outside engineering and machining. That's exactly what's happened here w/ 60 and 254. They just happened to negotiate a really outstanding price. The $3500 limit keeps it fair.


The difference is that the rules don't specifically call out requirement for accounting for engineering or design done by non-team members while they DO specifically require that non-team labor in making parts be counted against the $3500 limit.

The way I read the rules, there is no way that $3500 limit does not apply. BUT... ...is this the spirit of the rule? I don't think the rules were intended to prevent this type of labor sharing among teams.

As a practical matter, there is zero chance that FIRST is going to disqualify either team 60 or team 254... ...so for 2004 at least this practice is going to be allowed.

I think that FIRST is going to get an earful in the off season about this, especially if Kingman and Cheesy Poofs keep up that habit they have of winning regionals and placing high at the Championships.

Deciding what the rules should be next year is going to put Dean's statements about FIRST being for engineers not lawyers to the test...


Joe J.


good luck getting the balls out of there in an orderly fashion.. and oh, did i forget to mention you gotta get them in there first?


None of the robots revealed thusfar have even attempted to contain balls.. I see 2 reasons for this..

1. Those suckers are big and unven. And after a few rounds they'll be donuts.

2. Most of us only have 1 real game ball to test with. You pop it, you're screwed.




Is it really necessary to shoot down an idea just because you don't agree with it?  Maybe the teams that have ball-holding mechanisms just aren't done yet, or don't want to reveal their designs for doing so.  Have you considered that third reason?
I would just like to bring up one point...the build load did not decrease.

Yes it is true that we only made 1/2 of the robot ...but we made 4 robots... After school, work, and homeowrk, team 60 and 254 put in alot of very long nights. Every part that was made took quadruple the amount of time. Often it took hours or even days for that matter to finish a certan part...and several times we had to go back to the drawing board and re-design new mechanisms.
I hope that everyone realizes that there is more then one way to go about building robots. The students on team 60 and 254 have learned 4 times over the difficulties and challenges that robotics teams face.
I have realized the importance of communication. The students on our teams will walk away with a new lesson in life. They will walk away knowing that they will face challenges greater then themsleves, and they will know that working on a team will bring up new challenges and new ideas, and give them knowledge that they never thought possible


Greetings Teams:
Chairman's Awards Submissions

We want the judges to be able to get and view your submission.  If it won't go in their mailbox it won't get viewed.  FIRST recommends that you try to keep your submission under 1MB, and will be unable to accept submissions that are 10MB or higher.

Thank you for your understanding.

Go Teams!




OH, VERY BAD, VERY VERY BAD.
One week from submission deadline and FIRST places a file size limitation; my teams are finalizing their submission this week and their whole fomat may need to be changed because they can't received more than 1 MB?

*choking* :mad:  :(
Depression is caused by stress that you turn inward. There is no need to get depressed. Have a team meeting, talk about your situation, get a plan of action going, give people action items to work towards your primary goals.

I think #1 is going to be passing inspection. If you cant fit the bot in the max-size box you cant play, so you need to figure out how to get the size down to 30x36x60

second is making sure your bot at least runs - if it can move on the playfield you can at least push balls around, push the moble goal around, or be defensive by getting in your opponets face to keep them from scoreing faster than you

get the idea? time for an eleventh hour team meeting - set your priorities - do what you can before ship date, and you will probabally think of stuff after you ship it that you can do in the pits to make it even better.

Last year our team had a line following auton mode that worked sorta ok, but after we shipped the bot we realized a way to make it simpler, faster and more accurate. We totally redid our auton mode at our first regional, and we hit the wall dead center in 3 seconds in every match!

Dont dispair - you are getting a taste of what real engineers go through every day

the 11th hour is the finest hour!
Quick question: Why 4, when you only needed 2?


[size=2]Hi! guys I only have 7 more days and I am not even done with my IR sensors.[/size]
**** The problem I am having is Using navigate.c whenever i put navigate.c in my robot it doesn't work unless i connect the motors to PWM 3&4 and. Once I am done connecting the motors to PWM 3&4 the robot goes crazy it just goes everywhere and it doesn't move it's servon motors and doesn't detect beacon.

* When I put my Motors on PWM 13 & 15 the robot doesn't move at all it doesn't perform any movement all it does is just straightens up the sensors and that's it. The programm gives the command "MOVE TO CENTRE" but it doesn't perform the action.

* Does anyone know why I am having this troubles please help me? I am pretty much furustrated and if you want to contact me my msn is [email]jigarjuhi@yahoo.ca[/email] and that's my e-mail so it's 2 in 1. Please help me! :ahh:   :confused:   :(  ***




Ok, here goes,
What pwm's are you plugging the servos into?
Made sure that the cable orientation is correct the IR's, servos, motors, PWMs?
I'm loading up the navigate code right now!!
If someone could post on the Q+A system about this, but referring more generally to any sort of alignment assistant, that would be great.  I can't seem to find a relevant section in the rules, so i don't know what to put it under.
I cant remember if the team number switches are in Hex? Flip the switches one by one until you get to your team number :c)
I'm still confused as to why you chose to partner with each other, as you seem to have had a excellent relationship with each other already, so in the spirit of FIRST, why not help a rookie team?  This might become the norm,(partnering with rookie teams) for years to follow, but I'm concerned we're just going to start a spontaneous replication of teams that have already excisted.  Part of what makes FIRST so great to me, is the evolution of teams from, what six years ago?  It is amazing to see how great teams have become is that short amount of time.  Who knows? maybe this collaboration thing will be the best thing that has happened to FIRST, but we need to be careful on how far we go, to make sure this doesn't get ridiculous

By the way Stud Man, thnx for posting at the exact same time, These two posts are possibly the closest posts ever!!
I've been involved in FIRST for a short few years. Over these years I've come ucostum to as soon as I get to nationals ( which is all 4 years ) I've run over to team 60 and 254 ( and a few others  ) robots to check out how they individually solved each problem. What unique devices they may be using, and why they may have chosen to go with a certain solution. Each robot has been unique in its own way. Whether it be a little vast differences or very small all have been different. I've found one of the biggest learning experiences for me ( and funnest to say the least ) is when I get a break from the buzz of competion to just walk around and look at the other bots. To talk to those teams and see why they went a certain way, or put this nut here or this nut there. TO really figure out how things work. Now I have have 1 less team to visit and figure out how they did it.

You see the learning experience doesn't stop during construction. It goes on to competition or to everyone who looks at a picture on delphi, who studies the bot and says I like how they did this or I woulda changed this a bit. So in a way I feel a bit cheated. My learning experience may have been curved because of something like this. The very fact that now 2 power houses of teams have joined up somewhat dissapoints me, that FIRST now gets 1 for the price of 2. It is not that I'm upset with 60 or 254, I am just concerned. I do believe that now that they have done it, they have crossed that rubicon, if something is not done to stop it, what is to say that all 950 teams collaborate with each other where we only produce 425 robots.. what if it goes beyond there.. 3 or 4 or 5 teams start joining together and making things simpler. You see you drastically curve everything you create a blan game with no creativity. If FIRST wanted identical robots, if they had inteded this, they would have sent us parts that snap together and said here use this.. but only use this.. use nothing else.

I can understand what you mean about collaborating for a real world experience, however I'm somewhat confused where that example would fit. I'm not well aquainted with any situation where 2 companies involved in heavy competition would work together to create identical products. Thats like a Microsoft and Apple joining together to create 1 os and only selling that 1 os. This infact is called Collusion and is illegal in the United States because in all examples it reduces competition.

I'm not really upset with these teams. I don't believe they had bad intentions. I don't believe they believed it would give them a competitive edge because if won't. Infact if their bots are good they may even have to compete against each other in the finals.

Now I still don't believe it was right, the time and energy spent here could have been more justifiably been given to 2 different rookie teams without the resources of 254 and 60. Four teams would have been effected for the better.. wrather than 2 teams.

I'm dissapointed, but not angry. I think it was the right idea, just gone to far. It is my belief helping each other is great, but building half of each others robot for each other is not the way to go. Sharring drive trains designs and one or the other team perfecting them in different ways, good. Building the others for them, not good.

Not everyone will view this as good or bad. It is surely a new undiscovered avenue. I still await whether or not FIRST will release a statement. But it is my ernhest hope that the rest of FIRST does not venture down this avenue.

Dan

/edit sorry for spelling/grammar mistakes was in a hurry
I would think it would be legal.  I don'st see any rules against it. I saw a team that did it alst year.  There anrn't ant rules against it.  and overpressure isn't an issue bc there is a mechanical overpressure valve o n the compressor.


I'm don't like your intro page at all.
The logo is cool, but all the sponsors and FIRST logo make it look cluttered. I also don't think that you need to have the scrolling text along the bottom announcing the shipment date being pushed back.

However, I like the countdown timer. ^_^





Hi Jon,

Actually, the logo of which you spoke is just one huge link to our site.  It's not actually full of links to those respective sponsors (those links are on the sponsors page of our site).  We used the big JPG with our sponsors on it because that is our official team logo, so it made sense in context.

Also, I'm not sure if you asked this or not, but we created the entire site in good old fashioned Notepad.

On a final note, what did you think about our actual site? All you commented on was the intro page which isn't terrifically crucial in the long run.

Cheers,
Captain Dan
sooo,  basically their super duper master controller will send something to our operator interface which will start the robot's auton section and after 15 secs their super master controller tells it to exit auton mode and go to the non auton mode?
yea we have a wheelie bar too so we dont tip over
it should, unless for some reason they neglected to include any rom....
looks good. but i see his point it isnt obvious to click the logo to continue on :)

"All electrical devices must be isolated from the robot frame; the robot strucure may not be used to carry electrical current.  The **negative** (return) wiring must be electrically isolated (floating) from the robots frame.  (The isolated ground arrangement is neccessary due to polarity reversals that occur under certain operating conditions such as motor direction reversals.)"

-------------
Thats one main purpose for the ground stud!


Now.  Important points from each side:

1.  By working together both teams have learned something they never would've if they worked alone, and that is, the values of partnership, and learning to work with a new process.

2.  It is not as easy as you think to design a robot together.

On the other hand:

1.  Joe J. addressed his concern of many powerful teams working may tilt the playing field in their favor.

2.  Matt Adams addressed his concern of this collaboration with the spirit of the $3500 limit rule.





I found out about the alliance between 254 and 60 about 3 weeks ago.  When I first heard about it I was skeptical to say the least.  My first question was the same as Matt Adams.  How would this be accounted far as the 3500 dollars that can be spent?  This was answer by the fact that Laron is sponsoring the cheesy poofs.  If this is valid answer, I am not sure, but it is an answer to the question none the less.  I guess you just have to read between the lines of each and every rule.

Now my next question is exactly the one that Joe J. proposed.  What keeps companies and teams like Delphi, Ford, NASA, and GM from sending the same robot on the field with 16 different team numbers?  Right now I would say it isn't possible for 16 teams to come together and design 1 robot to suit the needs of all 16 teams, but last year I would have said it wasn't even possible for 2 teams to do it.  Especially teams as far away as 60 and 254.  So where does that leave the future of FIRST?  A regional comp with 64 teams entered but only 10 different robots?  That isn't something I personally would like to see happen.

I know for a fact that both team 60 and team 254 have nothing but the best intentions for the students on the team and for this partnership.  I think that for these teams it’s a great idea, but the idea can be taken to a different extreme and that is the scenario I don't want to see.

I guess all I can say is congratulations to both teams taking first to a different level weather it be a better or worse place.


How bout this:
Replace 2 wheels with omni's...
Probably the rear wheels. This will retain your 4 wheel strength while making your turning much slicker. I also think that with a small chamfer on the front wheels should do the trick.




are there any off the shelf 12 in omni or transwheels? i'd love to have them. never seen any big sized ones tho. probably too heavy. we can't machine our own, but id really like them
take the code from inside the Default_Routine() function, and put it in the User_Autonomous_Code() function (in user_routines_fast.c) instead. it should look like this:



/* in user_routines_fast.c */

void User_Autonomous_Code(void)
{
while (autonomous_mode)   /* DO NOT CHANGE! */
{
if (statusflag.NEW_SPI_DATA)      /* 26.2ms loop area */
{
Getdata(&rxdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will be stuck here forever! */

if(rc_dig_in06 == 0)  /* if dark is seen */
{
pwm01=pwm03=127; /* turn left motors off */
pwm02=pwm04=96; /* turn right motors forward slowly */
}
else
{
pwm01=pwm03=159; /* turn left motors forward slowly */
pwm02=pwm04=127; /* turn right motors off */
}

printf("%d
", rc_dig_in06); /* print light sensor readings */
Putdata(&txdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will get no PWM outputs! */
}
}
}

if inventor can (im pretty sure it can) open the file you want then go to save copy as and in the pull down menu u can choose a wide variety of formats.  hope this helps

-matt


looks good. but i see his point it isnt obvious to click the logo to continue on :)




True, but there is a "Click to Enter the Malvern Robotics Site" link right below that.


Quick question: Why 4, when you only needed 2?



Because of AUTONOMOUS silly!

Autonomy is forcing every team I know that is serious about trying to maximize there chances of doing well in the robot competition to build 2 robots -- one to ship and one to program autonomous mode with while you wait to compete at the regionals and championships. This is a serious problem for FIRST in the long run (more serious than the topic of this thread, imho), but it is off topic for this already overheated thread.

So, they had to build 4 of each so that both Team 60 and Team 254 can have an extra autonomy robot (for who among us reading this deeply into this thread can seriously doubt that both teams are serious about maximizing their chances of placing well in the robot competition -- whether they "put their ego's aside" or not... -- sorry Glenn, it was too easy).

Joe J.


"I need someone from 229 IMMEDIATELY!"  (okay bad example -- no one would ever want 229... ;))




But... the word on the street is that this is 229's year.  This could come true!

Andy B.
so
ha! i like both the german and the poet :)
I'll give you a bit more.

Yes it's a pulley/winch system. Yes it will hold. No it's actually not that heavy, but we want it lighter anyway. Yes, it backdrives, but not for long. You will be more impressed when you see some other stuff, I promise. That is, if our robot sheds some pounds.

> Because of AUTONOMOUS silly!


I know, I was more-so asking because "we had to build 4 robots" to me isn't a valid excuse.
Yeah I don't think they care when or how the compressor turns on or off as long as the pressure in the system never exceeds 120PSI.

They give you an analog pressure sensor for this reason -- to customize the control of the pump.


Quick question: Why 4, when you only needed 2?




One practice bot and one competition bot per team.
of course it doesn't move when you plug the motors into pwms 13 and 15 - navigate doesn't output to those pwms.

if it's moving crazily when you plug them in to pwms 03 and 04 (the correct ones), then you probably need to adjust the values in the program to suit your sensors, as well as make sure the servos are hooked up correctly.
You are both correct. If Timmy's got it, you have nothing to worry about.
This is a great looking tread system.  The adjustment mechanism in the front looks user-friendly.  The slight "bow" in the bottom will save you from throwing treads.  You Kil-a-Bytes really did your homework on this elegant design.

These guys were Rookie All-Stars in St. Louis last year, and St. Louis had many great rookies.  They look to be a formidable contender in 2004.

Good luck!

I figured those marks are from a mill. I could of course be wrong...

thanks andy that means alot coming from you :D thx to the technokats for helping us get started.  you should see the drive train we "tried" to build ;)
the team number DIP switch is in binary - here are the values of the switches:

1:   2048
2:   1024
3:   512
4:   256
5:   128
6:   64
7:   32
8:   16
9:   8
10: 4
11: 2
12: 1

just push up (towards the center) the switches whose values add up to your team number - for instance, our team (1020) pushes up all of the switches from 3 to 10, because 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 = 1020.
as i said.. that is a ghetto mock up. But, the finished version is gauranteed to catch all the balls 99.9% of the time. And our human player's average practice trial is 49 out of 50


I would just like to bring up one point...the build load did not decrease.

Yes it is true that we only made 1/2 of the robot ...but we made 4 robots... After school, work, and homeowrk, team 60 and 254 put in alot of very long nights. Every part that was made took quadruple the amount of time.

I cannot disagree more with your statements. If I KNOW I am going to make 4 of something, I can think about it as I design it and as I make it. For example, it may not be worth making a jig if I am going to make 1 but if I am going to make 4 -- it probably will be, possibly saving me huge amounts of time per part.

In short, I suppose that on average you can make 4 of something in 2-3 times the time it takes to make 1. Even if we take the high number of 3, then assuming each team shares the load equally, then each team only had to do 87.5% of the work they would have had to do had they made the parts themselves.

12.5% may not seem like much of a savings but that is almost another week of time saved during the 6 week build cycle.

Joe J.


How's the weight?




About 75 pounds. The scale was acting a little funny that day so it may be off by a bit.
basically, yes. a specific pin sets the status as to whether autonomous mode is enabled or not, and another pin sets whether the robot is disabled or not. the autonomous pin state is represented in code by the variable "autonomous_mode" - it will be a true value if auto mode is on, and 0 if not.
love your coloring job :D
HUGE wheels! how big are they?
are you really going to use the right handed joystick for your left hand too?
how many biological signs did you manage to sneak in?? :yikes:
Dez, all that says is that electricity must be isolated from the rest of the system.  This could be done with say... the ground wires on the BUSS fuse connector, like my team had up until this thread, or other such things.  I dont see how forcing the teams to use lower guage wires (ie, using the distro block ) adds safety.

Up until this, we had straight 6 awg wires running from battery (both terminals) to our fuse boxes, which is easily the safest it can get.  Instead, now we need to go to each fuse box with a lonely 10 awg wire, which is going to get a heck of a lot hotter than the 6.


I'm still confused as to why you chose to partner with each other, as you seem to have had a excellent relationship with each other already, so in the spirit of FIRST, why not help a rookie team?

Both Team 60 and 254 are helping rookie teams. And both teams are more then willing to help anyone who asks. I am a student on team 60 and our team loves good competition, we also love to "raise the bar". We didnt build identical robots to beat down other teams or garuante ourselves a win...there is no point in that. We did not expect everyone to like this idea of collaberation but we did expect everyone to think about FIRST in a different perspective. Our goal was to learn more...by putting in our ideas and adding ideas from other teams.


Try wrapping a pair (one from each drive train) of tires with something radially




Why not try zip ties? They're cheap, slick, durable, and quick to install!


sooo,  basically their super duper master controller will send something to our operator interface which will start the robot's auton section and after 15 secs their super master controller tells it to exit auton mode and go to the non auton mode?




To put it that way yeah thats what happens and if you want help on a dongle, feel free to pm me here on the CD forums or im me on aim at dezdezdez25
We did want to use a steering wheel, but a DB15 steering wheel that recenters correctly to 127, and doesnt suck, like most of the devices we have tried, is hard to come by!
What.
i must say that is one SWEEEEEEET robot.

can u hang or get the multiplier ball?


how about 884s? i think thats what we are using. also, a red spike and a blue spike? is that the difference in the letters? whats the REAL difference? is one better than another? please explain



The difference between the 883's (discontinued) and 884's is that the 883's have a larger deadband around the center (they provided control of approxmately 10-100% power in each direction, whereas the 884's provide ful 0-100% control in each direction).

The Spike Reds (long discontinued) defaulted to the "on" output state on both channels unless they were told by the RC to be "off"; the Spike Blue defaults to the "off" output state (safer).
8 Signs I think


we have to deliver our robot thuesday (because of the carnival holidays)




Is that tuesday or thursday?
It will be a surprise. :D
thats no fun :(
Im afraid these two teams have really opened up a can of worms here.

The rules state that all assemblies and mechanisms on your robot must either be designed and built by your team, or be parts that are commercially available off the shelf to all teams.

If I understand what these two teams have done, one designed and built the drivetrain and the other designed and built the upper chassis, arm....

I think if the judges hold these two teams to the spirit and intent of the rules, one is going to have nothing but a drivetrain and the other will have nothing but the upper chassis

because, if they are honest, when asked "did your team design and build this part of the robot?" they will have to answer no - and when asked, is this mechanism available commercially off the shelf? the answer is no

then the inspectors will be forced to say, Im sorry but you cant use that part on your robot.

I dont see any way around this.

you can agrue about the words design and build and try to estimate machine shop costs and all that, but the intent of the rules is clear - each team is suppose to design and build there entire machine by themselves. You cant subcontract half your robot design to anyone else, including other teams.
holy crizap, thats like an erector set on LSD, very cool though :)

> Thats one main purpose for the ground stud!


My diagram mets the requirments of "isolated from the robot frame". It doesn't say ground stud required does it? The distribution block is a form of isolation is it not?


None of the robots revealed thusfar have even attempted to contain balls..



At our meetings, the word "hopper" is regarded as an obscenity. Mention it and you'll be thrown out. I have only seen one good hopper bot -- it was in 2002 and it sucked up soccer balls like mad. I don't remember what team it was, but it kicked butt in its first couple matches at nationals .... then everyone figured out all you have to do is tip it over when it becomes so top heavy because of all the balls its carrying. :D
You can save an Inventor .ipt as .dxf using the Save File As command (File menu).  I don't have Inventor in front of me, but I believe that you just select the file type in a scroll list box at the bottom of the Save As dialog.

Post again if you still have difficulty.
1020 is student run and it was very difficult.  Aim to sustain a team and have fun while learning and growing and getting more people into FIRST.  It couldn't hurt to get some sleep, too!

I'm not implying anything, but if your depression goes beyond worries from the build season - don't hesitate to get some counseling - it's a pretty common thing to do.

Best of luck...hold on tight for week six!

well if we both agree it must be right :D
Let's try this again: FIRST Jeopardy for 500, the first theme ever used for a FIRST Jeopardy theme week.
You guys definitely had too much time on your hands. Of course that bot totally rocks, it's a machining masterpiece. The only question I have now is it just a flashy bot or does it function well too.
All i have to say is Holy Crap (sorry, i cant help myself).  That is the most beautiful thing i have ever seen *sniffle*

That is really an amazing job.  Did you anodize it?  Can that even be done in a regular machine shop? Wow....


My diagram mets the requirments of "isolated from the robot frame". It doesn't say ground stud required does it? The distribution block is a form of isolation is it not?




It is and it is not a form of isolation.  The way its a form of isolation is it is "isolated" from the frame but then its also not a form of isolation due to the constant flow of electricity right next to it.  The point of the distrib. block is to have the center empty with common on one side and hot on the other.  The ground stud is to place a common central ground area on the bot which comes directly from the batteries common terminal post.

> All i have to say is Holy Crap


You took the words right out of my mouth.  That's insanely amazing, but can it do anything besides drive around and climb the step?
That. Is. Beautiful. *tear*  :)

both teams worked together to design the bot, both teams shared the work load


Is that tuesday or thursday?




It is both, yet neither. :P


...and ignore the consequences of having a closed-relay server, as long as I tell people to use their own ISP's SMTP?



You can use POP-before-SMTP or SMTP AUTH to offer SMTP services to your users but not the general public.


Why not try zip ties? They're cheap, slick, durable, and quick to install!



Please read my whole post....

Zip ties are really a half-assed solution.  They kill probably more than half of your forward traction for the wheels you put them on.
Yes, it was a missing OI.  Thank you all.
clynch


Is it really necessary to shoot down an idea just because you don't agree with it?  Maybe the teams that have ball-holding mechanisms just aren't done yet, or don't want to reveal their designs for doing so.  Have you considered that third reason?




hmm... you might not have noticed my teammate's post, but we ourselves are planning to have a ball mechanism- I did not intend to shoot it down, I was just pointing out what I believe to be the 2 main reasons why the majority of robots so far don't have a ball mechanism..


sorry if i came off a bit harsh, that was my view and my view only, please dont discriminate against 341 because of what I said
So our team was part of this whole Shaveless Season, and I shaved a couple weeks ago and I was punished today, my head is shaved, watch for pics tommorrow.


well if we both agree it must be right :D



Actually, you can't save an ipt file as a dxf.  Unless it was added in version after 6.  You can howerver save a Drawing file (idw) as a .dxf.
That is flat out awesome... but where's the vacuum going to go? ^_^
Right now there are lots of questions about the legality of this collaboration, especially in terms of the cost accounting.  A question for teams 60 & 254;  Did any representative from either of your teams ask FIRST about whether your partnership was allowed?  I'm sure you guys realized that this was a gray area, so I am assuming you took care of this.

I'm curious as to what FIRST must have said.

Every season needs a couple of controversies, I guess this is the first one.


both teams worked together to design the bot, both teams shared the work load




thats not what members from both teams are saying on page one of this thread - the 2nd post on the 1st page says each team built half the bot.

The only way I can see to get out of this would be for the two teams to combine as one. If you are going to separate regionals that are not on the same weekend, you could both be team 60

and if you make it to the championship, you would have to be one team or the other, but not both.

And only play with one of the two teams robots.
We powder coated it. All you need is the equipment and a stove. Its time consuming though.


You guys definitely had too much time on your hands. Of course that bot totally rocks, it's a machining masterpiece. The only question I have now is it just a flashy bot or does it function well too.





It performs better than it looks.  :)
There a few issues that are being addressed here that I think some people are taking in the wrong direction.

Sharing the build load: Both teams are still going to spend all six weeks building, it's not like they finished early. They spent just as much time building as everyone else.

What if they both win both of their regionals: Well they probably would have done it anyway, not like it hasn't happened before.

This is not something that we can all just dismiss as wrong because we didn't think of it. I think everyone needs to kick-back relax and really think before you bad mouth these teams. Put yourself in their position. What if another team apporoached you to do this, what would you say?

Before you can say that they didn't work as hard or they cheated, I say try it, walk a mile in their shoes. Maybe you'll change your mind. I know I'm looking forward to trying this next year.
I don't like the check/register email acct links at the top, however I can't really think of a nother place to put them.

Also, I like that you're putting your links on the top, but is there a way you can make them smaller and fit on 1 row or 2 even rows?

Note: It loads fast. That's a plus.
NO WAY!! you guys are so wrong ... Clearly someone was sawing, breathing in saw dust all day long, had a terrible cold, and hawked up a big snotty loogy right into some cup nearby (to prevent having to go outside...)


...my goodness isnt it obvious??
Well, if you would search the threads before you posted, you would ahve found some.

Unfortunately, I only have the specs for 2003 and 2002, and they are..


2003 Fisher-Price (Manufacuted By Mabuchi):
Stall Torque: .38 N-m
Stall Current: 57 Amps
Free Speed: 15,000 RPM
Free Current: ?

W/ Gearbox
Gearbox Ratio: 124:1
Stall Torque: 34.7 N-m
Stall Current: 57 Amps
Free Speed: 100 RPM
Free Current: ?

2002 Fisher-Price (Manufacuted By Johnson & Johnson):
Stall Torque: .36 N-m
Stall Current: 57 Amps
Free Speed: 15,000 RPM
Free Current: ?

W/ Gearbox
Gearbox Ratio: 147:1
Stall Torque: 35 N-m
Stall Current: 57 Amps
Free Speed: 100 RPM
Free Current: ?

If those figure's aren't correct, even though I'm sure they are, do a search on 'fisher price spec' and you shoudl come up with them.

On a side note, does anyone have the motor specs for 2004, or any years prior to 2002? I'm bored and am currently putting together a spreadsheet consisting of all the motor specs throughout the years (basically everything I listed above). Any help would be appreciated.


Ok, here goes,
What pwm's are you plugging the servos into?
Made sure that the cable orientation is correct the IR's, servos, motors, PWMs?
I'm loading up the navigate code right now!!




I am currently using PWM 1 and PWm 2 for servo motors
I use the IR's in Digital I/O 1,2,3,4 and motors into PWM 13 and 15.
W O W!
*speechless*


AWESOME. It's a beauful thing!!!

What regional are you appearing at?
(me want to see, me want to see...)

:yikes:


NO WAY!! you guys are so wrong ... Clearly someone was sawing, breathing in saw dust all day long, had a terrible cold, and hawked up a big snotty loogy right into some cup nearby (to prevent having to go outside...)


...my goodness isnt it obvious??



***EEEEEEEWWW!!!***

***It was you wasn't it????? :p ***
Sniff, I'm actually crying, I've never seen a more beautiful robot in recent years then that. I sense you guys are going to be winning a lot of engineering, creativty, and visualization awards for that. If you don't, then it's a $@#$@#$@#$@# shame, because that is truely a work of art.

> What if another team apporoached you to do this, what would you say?


No. Due to the intent of the rules of the game as I posted above.

and besides, building the whole machine with your own team is half the fun.


It is and it is not a form of isolation.  The way its a form of isolation is it is "isolated" from the frame but then its also not a form of isolation due to the constant flow of electricity right next to it.  The point of the distrib. block is to have the center empty with common on one side and hot on the other.  The ground stud is to place a common central ground area on the bot which comes directly from the batteries common terminal post.





That same Distribution block is used in everyday 3 PHASE power applications. It's not designed to always have the center empty, sorry but why would they design it like that?

It's rated to handle any and all equal current as the outer lugs.

Allen Bradley's Mini Power blocks are rated up to 115 AMPS

http://www.ab.com/industrialcontrols/products/terminal_blocks_and_wiring/power_distribution/pdf/powerblocks.pdf

I am just trying to find out where it says we are required to use the ground lug, when in fact the distribution block is the same if not better.
that looks like a tall 12 or 16oz dixie cup which has a latex based paint in it.  I am going to guess that it has to do with younger kids maybe helping the team paint say their crate or a room or their shop.


***EEEEEEEWWW!!!***

***It was you wasn't it????? :p ***





ummm...*cough*... no way!!
If you still have a copy of max 5 you can install both that and your copy of inventor on the c drive. you can go into max and under the plugin paths add the Autodesk Inventor folder (I think it's the bin folder you want but not positive). Add the subpaths. next time you boot up max 5 you should be able to import an iam straight in. save it as a max file (or export as 3ds) and open it in your copy of max 6.


The difference is that the rules don't specifically call out requirement for accounting for engineering or design done by non-team members while they DO specifically require that non-team labor in making parts be counted against the $3500 limit.

The way I read the rules, there is no way that $3500 limit does not apply. BUT... ...is this the spirit of the rule? I don't think the rules were intended to prevent this type of labor sharing among teams.

Joe J.




Just as a reference, I found this part in the rule book:

Under section 5.3.2.2

The cost of raw material obtained by a team + the cost of non-team labor expended to have the material processed further. Team member processing labor is not included. Example: A team purchases steel bar stock for $10.00 and has it machined by a local machine shop that donates its 2 hours of expended labor. The team must include the estimated normal cost of the labor as if it were paid to the machine shop, and add it to the $10.00. Exception Examples: If the team members themselves did the actual machining, there would be no associated labor cost. If the machine shop
were part of the team, its labor cost would not apply.


Under this rule, I would say that any parts made by team 60 on the 254 robot should not count as "if the team members themselves did the actual machining", unless they are now considered one team.
Well from what i see there is a goal latch and the ability to go over those steps...are there more subsystems to come?
It's proof.  Aliens are real and they have invaded 294.  After winning Chairman's Award by controlling the judges with their mind control goo, they will come for me and the secret plans they have marked in my hair.

By the way, my shrink keeps using the word "paranoid" but I haven't the slightest idea what it means.  Can someone help me out?


Because of AUTONOMOUS silly!

**Autonomy is forcing every team I know that is serious about trying to maximize there chances of doing well in the robot competition to build 2 robots** -- one to ship and one to program autonomous mode with while you wait to compete at the regionals and championships. This is a serious problem for FIRST in the long run (more serious than the topic of this thread, imho), but it is off topic for this already overheated thread.

So, they had to build 4 of each so that both Team 60 and Team 254 can have an extra autonomy robot (for who among us reading this deeply into this thread can seriously doubt that both teams are serious about maximizing their chances of placing well in the robot competition -- whether they "put their ego's aside" or not... -- sorry Glenn, it was too easy).

Joe J.




I really have to disagree with the bolded segment- we are serious about doing well in this competition, but there is no way we could build 2 robots. First of all, we would not be able to afford two of every part, considering we are using almost every motor. Buying an additional OI, a bunch of spikes and victors, and all the other parts for our robot is just simply not possible. But hey, we still showed up all day on friday, saturday, sunday, and monday, 50+ hours in total over the weekend.

Keep in mind we are a veteran team with access to a full machine shop (tech center alliance), chances are if we can't make a second robot then the majority of other teams can't as well..


I can tell you we would LOVE to have a second daisy to practice autonomous with. The fact is, we can't do that. Last year we seeded 4th in Galileo and won it all even after only having one robot, thanks to our programmer spending hours on perfecting his gyro. I applaud all of the teams that can achieve this, but we're thrilled to just finish our one robot.
hey how much does anodizing cost anyway!? my team gets it done for free so i kinda dont know


take the code from inside the Default_Routine() function, and put it in the User_Autonomous_Code() function (in user_routines_fast.c) instead. it should look like this:



/* in user_routines_fast.c */

void User_Autonomous_Code(void)
{
while (autonomous_mode)   /* DO NOT CHANGE! */
{
if (statusflag.NEW_SPI_DATA)      /* 26.2ms loop area */
{
Getdata(&rxdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will be stuck here forever! */

if(rc_dig_in06 == 0)  /* if dark is seen */
{
pwm01=pwm03=127; /* turn left motors off */
pwm02=pwm04=96; /* turn right motors forward slowly */
}
else
{
pwm01=pwm03=159; /* turn left motors forward slowly */
pwm02=pwm04=127; /* turn right motors off */
}

printf("%d
", rc_dig_in06); /* print light sensor readings */
Putdata(&txdata);   /* DO NOT DELETE, or you will get no PWM outputs! */
}
}
}






thanks alot for your help!
Just wondering, do you guys have any center of gravity problems?
I think one of the most important things to remember in this thread is that these teams **did not** collaborate to gyp everyone else out of a competition, they didn't conspire against teams, etc.  A lot of the negative comments seem to think this is so.

The best way to describe this is *change*.  Some people like change, they think it's a great idea, and they can't wait to integrate it into their lives.  But there's always someone who doesn't like the idea, no matter what way it affects them.

Of course we all have differing ideas about this: 'These two teams are cheating!'  'They're undermining the program!'  and 'What a great idea!'  'I hope we see more of this in FIRST!'  But it comes down to inspiring students, recognizing that we NEED to keep science, engineering, and technology readily available to students, and knowing that all of us - engineer, parents, peer, or otherwise - can make a difference.

I'm not going to take a side, because like I'm sure most people see, there are good and bad aspects to this.  But these teams are going into uncharted territory and **trying** to do something for the betterment of FIRST teams, and that alone should be recognized and applauded.
As delta pointed out, 3 and 4 are the correct ones (how did you come up with 13 and 15?). I would just recomend leaving them unplugged or blocking up the robot to see how it acts through the debug port.
MAXscript allows for recurring transformations to occur when you want them to (like when an object nears a target).  There are just some things that are really inefficient using the graphical system.  That is the nature of a GUI.

This is just an ambigous way of posting the main focus of our storyline without giving it away yet.  Hope everyone is doing well and on track for the fast approaching deadline.


Sharing the build load: Both teams are still going to spend all six weeks building, it's not like they finished early. They spent just as much time building as everyone else.
Before you can say that they didn't work as hard or they cheated, I say try it, walk a mile in their shoes. Maybe you'll change your mind. I know I'm looking forward to trying this next year.




I have thought about this topic all day and gone back and forth on it.  But in the end, my gut tells me that collaboration to this extent is bad.

This first statement is the one thing that I dislike about this collaboration.  I think that strategy discussion, and sharing of discussion between teams is a great thing, especially between a veteran and a younger team.  But the fact is, that these two teams each had about 4 weeks to design and build 1/2 of a robot.  If you had 4 weeks to build just a drivetrain, or just an arm, and could focus all of your resources on that, imagine what many teams could accomplish.  That would be a tremendous advantage. Collaboration is good, and does build communication skills, and an appreciation for a corporate atmosphere, but to this extent, I think it is against what we are trying to do.
that is a great base design. im really impressed. would the issue of ridding up on balls occur with the wheels being exposed and not guarded? by the way, great job at nationals last year guys :)


Today w/ some help, I imported our robot as a .IGES file into 3DS Max, then converted it to an editable mesh and separated it by selecting each piece by "element" and detaching them.  Tedious? A little, but it works fine... if anyone is having major problems w/ plugins and such, I would try doing this... but don't try importing a HUGE file into Max as .IGES, because it can't handle it.  :]





IGES files tend to be huge, did your tedious work make it any smaller??  If so I would think that is the best option.
I really dont know what all this hype is all about.  What is FIRST?  FIRST is: **F**or **I**nspiration and **R**ecognition of **S**cience and **T**echnology.  The way I'm **INSPIRED** may not be the way you are **INSPIRED.**  Does that mean that if a team decides to build their robot in a different way than you build yours make it wrong?  No way!  I saw a post above that said that it isnt nearly as fun for the teams when they build this way.  How do you know that?  Your team hasnt tried building your robot like this so you dont know.  I keep reading this over and over and all the other topics in the hundreds of other threads saying how "if you dont make your robot like ours, then you are wrong".  Everyone is **INSPIRED** differently.  At one time I had the same argumements as a bunch of you folk, but I have since changed my mind to not worry about how other teams decide to run thier teams and build their robots.  Different is not wrong, different is.... different.

I know i keep saying it but FIRST is all about **INSPIRATION**.




After I posted this, I saw what Amanda Morrison posted.  I agree with you Amanda all the way.
1)wire one side's positive (red) wire to the relay FWD output. With the ground wire to your ground.
2)Wire the other sides positive wire to relay REV. Wire ground to ground.
3)Switch relay with buttons
4)Voilla.. you have movage


By the way, my shrink keeps using the word "paranoid" but I haven't the slightest idea what it means. Can someone help me out?



Paranoid: adj. (see Crop-Circles)
I'm going to refrain from posting my opinion until I think about this more.
I urge others to do the same.

As to the legality of this:
We'll have to wait and see. I'm sure, given the discussion, some "official" ruling will be made. Although... I ask: would anyone WANT to deny these 2 beloved and respected teams entry into this game?

My interpretation(s):
-Yes there is enough grey area that 254 and 60 should OF COURSE be allowed to compete this year, as shown.
-Yes Laron can be 254's sponsor, even if they have never been listed thus far. Therefore: All parts made by 60 are allowable on 254's robot.
-Heck... Team 60 can be sponsored by "Team 254" and Team 254 can be sponsored by "Team 60"...

This may change for 2005, it may not.
There is enough grey here that this seems legal for 2004.


Obviously both teams benefitted from this.
The students on these teams benefitted from this.
The FIRST community will likely benefit from this... it will definitely be the start of something.

These are just my interpretations on the "legality" of this.
Nothing official here.
Keep that in mind.

Opinions to come later,
JVN


I am currently using PWM 1 and PWm 2 for servo motors
I use the IR's in Digital I/O 1,2,3,4 and motors into PWM 13 and 15.


I believe the IR sensors belong on digital 1&2 and digital 4&5.
Verify by looking at the comments in the header of the receiver.c file.

The motors go on pwm3 & 4
The servos go on pwm1 & 2
Verify by looking at the code in navigate.h
Hey!  Don't bash the GUI :-P

I liked your animation a lot last year and this year it looks like it will be awesome again.  Deadlines... oh boy.

Team 75 is attending both the PA and NJ regionals, so I'll see you there! Later.
Too true.
However, I don't think that all posts like this are meant to be critical.  I know that when our team experiences a problem and I see another team that accomplished what we could not, I would like to know how.  I'm not disagreeing with you, I just wanted to point out that not all of these posts are meant to bash robots.  Sometimes people just need to be carefull how they word things.
Well... yes there is a goal latch, but it is not installed. As far as sub-systems, they're all still to come.
at the risk of sounding dumb, how does the AND thing work, and what do I need to do with it?
You can wire the double selenoids in that way, or you can wire it to 2 relays as my team did last year.

To wire it to 2 relays, wire the postive/negatives on 1 side of the selenoid to the postive/negatives on the relay, and the other side of the relay, positive to a breaker and the negative to a ground. Wire the other side of the selenoid in the same way.

Both ways mentioned will work, it's just a matter of preference.
Mad. Props. From 188.
for some odd reason, i decided to use wierd variable names in our filtering code.
the variable to refer to the pwm is "watermelon", and the one to refer to the joystick is "napalm"... kind of funny seeing things like:

if ( (watermelon - napalm) &gt; (p2_wheel / 10) )
...
Truly madly, I have never seen a FIRST robot look like anything close to that. But that may just be me. Judging from the replies, it may not be =D

awesome job! look forward to seeing it at CR



wait a few weeks and experience a regional...





This is not just true for rookies, but also for veteran teams. I myself know last year the majority of my team believed that the game would be all about stacking. But hey, look at what happened, stacking was minimal.

The robots that get bashed the most might be the most successful ones. I see it this way, you're commenting on something when you don't really know what the game is. Nobody knows what the game will be like until the first set of regionals actually starts.

Overall, I like what Andy is thinking.. I sometimes am guilty of this, we all are, but we should either keep our negative thoughts to ourselves or find a 'nicer' way to express them..


Just wondering, do you guys have any center of gravity problems?




Dealing with this robot's center of gravity has been one of the most challenging aspects of its design.  As such, our solution is also the design element that we expect to give us the most problems during competitions.

Our problems are not as you may expect, however, in that we're not too worried about it tipping over as it drives around the field.  The arm and claw mechanism weigh 35 lbs. and can be stored directly above the robot, and while this does raise the center of gravity slightly, it's not nearly as concerning as having a 10' long arm extended outward from the robot is.

The challenge we faced was that of an additional unknown that many FIRST robots do not have to consider.  Many teams, when designing robots, can safely assume that their chassis orientation with respect to Earth does not change -- that is, things are always level or at some known angle.  Our design does not have this assurance, and so insuring that our chassis remains level to Earth was a prime design consideration.  Therein lies our problem with center of gravity.  An unknown or errant center of gravity means that keeping our robot's orientation known and controlled is very difficult, if not impossible.

We do, however, believe we have a viable solution. :)


love your coloring job :D
HUGE wheels! how big are they?
are you really going to use the right handed joystick for your left hand too?
how many biological signs did you manage to sneak in?? :yikes:




No, we have a left handed joystick available, but we may not need it.
This one should be easy to sort out.  This predicament has been foreshadowed cryptically by FIRST in Team Update #10 as follows:

“FIRST staff and volunteers will vigorously support and enforce the 2004 rules as written.  Team’s excellent and creative work that may not align / be in agreement with the rules will be acknowledged as excellent work but will be disallowed.”  This statement is no longer cryptic.  It describes the collusion that has occurred between these two teams.  I hope this is nipped quickly to stop the impending slide into mega-alliances that will eliminate the growth of FIRST.

The collaboration is indeed excellent and creative.  But currently it is NOT in agreement with the rules.  The robot was not designed and built by members of your team.  Each team contracted a significant portion of robot manufacturing to non-team members (just because it was another FIRST Team doesn't make it okay).  The manufacturing costs associated with this excellent and creative work MUST be valued per the rules.  Or, I suppose that each team could REMANUFACTURE the offending subsystem with their team members prior to the deadline…..Otherwise, I don’t see how either team should be allowed to complete - unless it is under a single team number!

There are also some other basic flaws with the approach that are not aligned / in agreement with FIRST philosophy, as I see them:

1.  It dilutes student involvement and creativity in the design and build concept of the ENTIRE robot.
2.  It inspires students to collude in completing high school and college assignments.  Doing somebody else’s work crosses the line.  It isn’t the same as tutoring or coaching.
3.  If this becomes the norm, it will gradually discourage rookie teams from forming unless they can find a mega-alliance to partner with.  Established teams will start to drop out as the stakes increase each year and it stops being fun because they can’t compete on the same level.

Arguments that this is a unique strategy that benefits the students are way off base.  Claiming this teaches students to “think outside the box” is a feeble attempt at rationalization.  The FIRST competition gives you many opportunities to “think outside the box” without the need to “think outside the team”.  You are robbing the students of some valuable learning experiences within your own teams.  Who actually spent “hours on the phone and numerous emails between the teams”?  Was it the students, or was it the engineers?
:::Claps hands:::

Couldn't agree with you more Andy.

No robot will ever be 100% perfect (no matter how great you think your bot is), so please commend the people that have posted pictures.

I think a lot of the problem is wording.  Like Andy said, "think before you post".  Saying something like (using example from team 1067 awesome marble wheels) "Wow! That’s truly amazing, how's it handle the carpet?"  Is a heck of a lot better than saying "Those marble are not going to get any traction, you should use something else".  Note: I am just making a general example, and not actually commenting about 1067's wheels at all (though they are really cool).

So please think before you post, it will give you, your team, and the FIRST community a much better reputation.

Are you utilizing PWM 13 and PWM 15 because you are using a tank drive system?

> are there any off the shelf 12 in omni or transwheels? i'd love to have them. never seen any big sized ones tho. probably too heavy. we can't machine our own, but id really like them


Well, I didn't have much luck finding an actual 12" omni... but...
You could make a small plate (doesn't even need to be circular) and bolt or lock an omni at each corner. Basically you're making a bigger omni with off the shelf omni's that are smaller. All it means is that you need more small ones.
You should be able to do this with common tools.
Wow!!! (is in awe)  pretty.  Are there any parts that arn't milled and finished?  U did the powercoating yourself?  Care to share any links/info?


NO WAY!! you guys are so wrong ... Clearly someone was sawing, breathing in saw dust all day long, had a terrible cold, and hawked up a big snotty loogy right into some cup nearby (to prevent having to go outside...)


...my goodness isnt it obvious??




Creative Vern 8-)

Actually it looks like one of my wacky elementry school science experiments B-P
Beautiful bot.  Makes me wish that we annodized our bot green instead of painting it.  Hate to admit it but your bot is prettier than ours this year.

Is that a goal grabber on the front?  Is that what the pnematics are for?  Or are they for a climbing mechanism?
It's a pretty good post, Andy, but how much does that thing weigh?!
For those of you who are still in debate, would you mind posting what you plan on doing once you figure it all out?

Thanks


Wow!!! (is in awe)  pretty.  Are there any parts that arn't milled and finished?  U did the powercoating yourself?  Care to share any links/info?




Yep, we did it ourselves. Ebay has some good powder coating stuff sometimes.



-Heck... Team 60 can be sponsored by "Team 254" and Team 254 can be sponsored by "Team 60"...






I never thought about that from this angle.  Thanks John.

And on that note, I think we can all take a break on this topic and absorb the material in this thread.  I think many good points have been made.  This is a rather constructive discussion, if a little unfocused from time to time, but I think that's ok.

I tried using the thread view only to look at this thread, but found it is impossible to seperate sub topic from sub topics.  So, my recommendation is everyone please remember to quote the post you are replying to so we can maintain the train of thoughts.  Try not to reply to all sub topics in one post, and instead reply to individual posts.

Thanks.
They look sweet.  Are they plow things to push the samll balls?  And are they airbrushed?  If not, how did you paint them?
how
this is the section of the rulebook that is going to be the problem for these two teams, and I dont see anything grey about it:


> 5.2.5 Design and Build Rules
> &lt;R09&gt; Teams must fabricate and/or assemble all custom parts and assembled mechanisms on the robot by the
> 2004 team after the start of the Kick-off. Mechanisms from previous year’s robots may not be used,
> however, individual off-the-shelf components from previous year’s robots may be re-used to save the cost
> of re-purchase of these parts IF they meet ALL of the 2004 Additional Parts and Materials Rules.


I hope these two teams work out some sort of agreement with FIRST, so they can compete - but I also home FIRST makes it clear that collaboration on this level is not in the spirit of FIRST.
It somewhat looks like something being born out of mud. Like a snake or maybe someone just did in fact hob up a big loogy and that is the end result of everything.
does a sentence even have a "Back" ::ahh::?
Nice paint job, it somewhat reminds me of our crate this year.
they were in fact air brushed, and even I'm surprised at how well they came out for even non-professionals
I want to say something.. but I'm all choked up :: tear :: thas just to beautiful for words

> Is that a goal grabber on the front? Is that what the pnematics are for? Or are they for a climbing mechanism?


I would like to point out that some of these questions were already answered in this thread.  They have goal grabbers, but they were not installed for this picture.

It is my belief that they can just drive up the steps and do not need the pnuematics to climb.  However, I do not know what the pnuematics are for.
andy = 11 green boxes
you = 1


I have seen many times where there is a person giving out criticism left and right, and then they are suprised that their whole team is ignored at a competition.




Oh so true. But I guess I can say I'm part of that group. I'd admit this, I can be a pain. I know. Sorry guys. But back onto the topic.

If you have the time and energy to critique another team's robots parts and it's weight, etc, then I think you might want to work with your bot now. Lets keep our little noses out of other teams till the ship-date, then we can have *REAL* fun. Tehehehe  :cool:
eurgh. scrolling status bar = ubercheesy. ripoff of flash movie = not quite gracious/professional. same title on every page = not a very polished site.

for a team with a $40k budget, you could probably do better.
nice robot, can't wait to see it at the Canadian regionals
This thread is hilarious.

I would participate in similar obfuscatory antics, but I'm the only person on my team who can do the programming, and I'm hoping to keep my code fairly self-explanatory and well-commented so that my freshman apprentice can carry on in my stead after I graduate. It's really a shame - properly obfuscating code is an underappreciated art.


You can use POP-before-SMTP or SMTP AUTH to offer SMTP services to your users but not the general public.




I don't want to offer SMTP service to my users. After doing a lot of research and talking to some of my old pals at [JLC](http://www.jlc.net) who ran email there when I worked there, it just ain't worth it.  I want to offer POP/IMAP service to my users, while making them go through their own ISP for SMTP purposes.

If you want to avoid having a separate ground return wire, do it this way:

Connect the cathode of a 1N4001 or similar diode to one red lead. Connect the anode of another diode to the other red lead. Connect the anode of the first diode and the cathode of the second to the M+ terminal on a Spike, and connect both of the black leads to M-. This method has worked well for me.
3 major hints eh?

It appears that you are using both the drills and both the cims for your drivetrain.

The pnuematics in the middle look like they are for some sort of wings to help herd the balls.

What other hints am I missing?
correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't seem to remember anything in the rules that says it is not possible for two different teams to be made up of the same people. if a team wants to pay the registration fee twice and recieve two kits of parts, then I think (emphasis on think) that they are, or at least should be, able to enter two robots.  for all intents and purposes, 60 and 254 have aligned to form one team.  since they are the same team, all the sponsors of one count as all the sponsors of the other.  the only thing different about this new team is that they have decided to pay double the registration fee in order to enter two robots instead of one.

The argument that the alignment allows the concentration of too many resources is not quite logical.  after a certain point, more money does not get you anything.  for example, if a team has a $30k a year budget, there is pretty much nothing that is out of their price range.  if they merged with a really big team, and as a result of that now have $500k to work with, they haven't really gained anything robot wise - they can still only put $3500 into the robot.  all that extra money and resources goes into travel and food and marching bands and stuff like that.

Everyone is saying that these two teams have cut corners and decreased their workloads by corroborating.  has anyone taken into account the sheer size of the problems involved in coordinating two groups of people in the building of a single integrated robot?  Our team's subgroups have enough of a hard time coordinating amongst themselves to get things to fit right, i can't imagine how difficult it would be to coordinate with a team in another state!

As a last request, i would ask that we PLEASE refrain from bringing up the subject of student built vs. engineer built.  there is no evidence either way for that argument, and so it is foolish to make that accusation.  that topic has been beaten into the ground many many many times, and is not what is being discussed here.


flame away... I can take it.



Flame, flame, flame, flame, flame...


Seriously though.
Baker's 200% right (a rare occurance, I know ;)).
This exact topic has been bugging me for the past few weeks.

It's one thing to be inquisitive:
"Wow, how much does that weigh? How did you get that to work!?"

It's another thing to be degrading:
"Too heavy. That'll never work unless you blah blah..."

And something Andy left out, my favorite is always:
"We thought of that... but decided it was stupid/heavy/not for us..."
If you ever find yourself typing those words, or similar words... unless they are immediately followed with "But this is awesome! We couldn't have done it this well!" just stop.

Andy--
You're gearbox will never work. We thought of a ball drive, but decided it was impractical. Techno-wang? we can do it better. ;)
*salutes*

It's a pretty good post, Andy, but how much does that thing weigh?!

FYI, Joel told a joke.  It was pretty funny too.

AB
Things have been so negative on these forums lately... your grandmothers would all CRINGE.  Can you believe what we've heard so far?

Comes down to this:

-Please follow the guidelines of 'constructive criticism' if you have criticism at all.
-Say what you would only say to your own team.  If you are going to question someone else's ethics or team skills, you should be able to question your own.
-If you have something particularly biting to say that you think NEEDS to be said publicly, feel free to confront a team at a regional.  If you would have trouble saying it to their face, don't say it here.
-THINK before you SPEAK.  Don't overreact.  Come back to the forums an hour or two after you read a thread, and make sure you consider all arguments or comments when posting.
-It'll never hurt to say something privately to a team first before saying it publicly.

and last but not least: STAY POSITIVE!

We're all in this for the long haul!  We like this program, we like what it's doing.  We like helping.  We like inspiring.  We like playing with power tools, stripping wire, or just stripping for alliance partners...  We're all students, mentors, parents, peers, people.  We all have things in common.  If you wouldn't like it said to you, don't say it.

/edit: I didn't say I was the one stripping for an alliance partner!  That all came from what I read in [this thread](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=104825&postcount=8) ... before my time.   :rolleyes:
Oops!  Clark's right - you'll have to make a 2D drawing of the part (a .idw) and save it as .dxf.  You can save a .ipt as .igs (solid or wireframe), if that helps.


the solonoids are not polarity sensitive - if current flows through the two wires they will trip

and I would be really surprized if the compressor cares which way it runs - the motor makes the piston go up and down - I dont think it cares if it goes down and up instead.




I believe the single solenoid was connected to an external ground not on the spike (as we generally do for all our double or single solenoids, but I did not wire it personally).  I will have to take a good look at the program, wires, and pneumatics to figure it out.

Quote from the 2004 Pneumatics Manual:
"Ensure that the relay is programmed to provide “forward” power only to the
compressor. Do not reverse the compressor!"
Your battery appears to be labeled "FISSION". Given that the standard battery uses a simple reduction-oxidation reaction, I'm quite curious. Did you check the flowchart to make sure fission reactors are allowed? :P

Seriously, though, that is one nice-looking robot. Good job.


MAXscript allows for recurring transformations to occur when you want them to (like when an object nears a target).  There are just some things that are really inefficient using the graphical system.  That is the nature of a GUI.

This is just an ambigous way of posting the main focus of our storyline without giving it away yet.  Hope everyone is doing well and on track for the fast approaching deadline.




Particle Flow system allows you to have complex procedural behaviors, including finding target and checking for distance - all through GUI ;)
Can't wait to see evryone at the Canadian Regionals  :)


Arguments that this is a unique strategy that benefits the students are way off base.  Claiming this teaches students to ?think outside the box? is a feeble attempt at rationalization.  The FIRST competition gives you many opportunities to ?think outside the box? without the need to ?think outside the team?.  You are robbing the students of some valuable learning experiences within your own teams.  Who actually spent ?hours on the phone and numerous emails between the teams??  Was it the students, or was it the engineers?




If you have never tried a similiar approach, how do you know if it doesn't work?  You may have speculations, but on what grounds are you able to tell another team how they should and should not be run?  There is no right way to run a team and even if it didn't work out well, at least they tried something new.
go to hfa.org and follow the instructions for sampling.
I'm very confused as to what the whole mechanism at the top is.

It's a pnuematic that is rotated by the window motor, but what does it do and why is it attatched with zip ties and what's with the glove? There's more to come I hope.


It performs better than it looks.  :)




I can't wait to see your robot in action then. I am still stunned :ahh:  at how cool it looks.
You guys are hysterical!  Thanks again for a great laugh.  Wow, best thread I've seen yet.  Maybe I'll start naming all of my variables after Toronto Maple Leafs players now.  The really slow motor speed will be JYRKE_LUMME.  The super-fast speed will be MATS_SUNDIN and the game-saving kick-$@#$@#$@# strategy mode will be a call to Ed_Belfour().  And whenever we get in a pushing match with another bot we'll just call in Tie_Domi() to sort things out...

:p
Make a scene.  Have particles chase a target.  Once successful, have them chase another target at random in the scene.  Do that without a script and with one event.  I want to know how!
please disregard what i just posted... my links are out of date.
I use windows movie maker for all of the videos i make with friends...its very easy to use. The only real problems I've had with it is the limitation there is on editing. An example is that you will have a little trouble editing out the middle of scenes, it is far easier to edit the middle and end. But i really enjoy using it.
Ok, I think I have decided on some things:

**The 1st NRG RoboCoder Competition**

Ken and John,

I don't think that sponsorship can be just made up as we go or else the $3,500 rule is just so much non-sense.

My particular part of Delphi has no shop to make a single part for our robot.  If I want to get something made I have to apply the $3,500 limits or my team has to make it.  If I can just call anyone who does work for me a sponsor or team member, then the rule has no teeth, especially, if I can barter for the goods and services.

Remember Dean's statement that words mean what they mean?  Well, the rules discuss even donated labor having to be accounted for.

If all I have to do is call one my donator one of my team sponsors why even discuss such a thing as donated labor?

I am back where I started on this one.  I don't think I like this.

Let's do a thought experiement...  ...suppose that this was done by ChiefDelphi and another Delphi team or two.

Based on the heat that Chief Delphi has taken over the years for pushing the limits of (what I feel at least) were more grey rules, I am sure that the calls for our heads would have been as loud as they were relentless.

If you'd be upset if Chief Delphi did this, what is different about these two teams doing it?

Joe J.
We use the welding shop however we still have to put stuff away because there are a lot of trouble makers in that class ex: welding pliers and or vise grips togather and just not respecting others property it is really to sad. :(
Looks like a soldering iron on steroids :confused:

What?...it's just a mad scientist's laser?  Oh well...close enough
I'm fired?  well translate this....
&lt;div&gt;execute jedi programming master&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; execute autonomous program&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; have a nice day &lt;/div&gt;

:)  :D  :)
Wow, I'm sorry but I have to say something. Now I'm probably going to get flamed and ridiculed for saying this, but I must.

This has got to be one of the biggest jokes I have seen on these forums in quite some time. You want to sponsor a programming competition, yet you must pay an entry fee to be eligable? You keep 50% of the profit from all the entrys to go to your team right? And let me guess, you use those profits to fund your team to go to Nationals if you make it right? How about make it where there is no entry fee and teams do it for FUN. That is what FIRST is about, not trying to squeeze money out of teams to fund yourselves.

Go ahead and flame all you want, but personally, I am insulted by this.
I highly agree with you Andy. Besides being downright mean, a lot of things are said here just to boost ther poster's ego by hurting others it seems. That is definatly not the way to go. I mean if you dont have something postive or useful to contribute, then why waste you energy to post it?





We like playing with power tools, stripping wire, or just stripping for alliance partners...




That last part is intruiging...  :yikes:
Some members of our team have seen some very late nights.  I was not present for this, but about 6 members went to one members garage with the robot and stuff.  This was late last friday night after a long meeting with the whole team up at the school.  Those members were working in the guy's garage until about 6 a.m. and the next meeting started at 9 a.m. which they were all present for.  So those team members might have gotten 2 hours of sleep between two days meetings.

Our team gets to use the drama room at our high school.  However, we do have a shop in a side room inside the drama room where we can keep all of our stuff.
Ok, i am going to take that flash animation off. As far as the budget goes if you would read further or even near the top it says "2003 Finances" believe me our finances are not near that this year. We lost many sponsors this year, and all of our money went towards paying for the robot and event. Therfore the site is made with programs on my own computer, which was bought with my money, not G-Force's. Thanks for the comments, i like to here what people have to say, that way i can improve the site as much as possible. By the way, what would you think of a Flash design instead?


and I know what it's like to be isolated from the team.
You never know, some day he might start working his butt off, knowing what he's doing,  and prove to be very helpful.





We have a team member who did nothing his freshman year except attend meetings. He's developed over the years into working his butt off and very much knowing what he's doing.


Looks like a soldering iron on steroids :confused:

What?...it's just a mad scientist's laser?  Oh well...close enough




Big jobs call for big tools, y'know. :D

I don't know but I was thinking of it being a fundraiser.  But actually that's a good idea - I'll talk it over with my team's advisor.


http://www.friarbot.com

Any thoughts?

~webmaster dan




Well... Your intro page has too much info in it. It should just be straight forward with like your team logo or a flash animation. The schedule (and maybe sponsors) should probably be in your main site...

As for the main site, i do have a few suggestions... For one, the graphics used seem to be quite choppy (may I recommend using an application other than MS Paint?) Additionally, may i suggest that you manage content from different users in a database (I'm sure your server supports some MySQL database, since it supports PHP). This would make it easier for your users to post, and would keep the fonts used totally consistent.

I would also have used a different style, but that's really up to you...

Your site does have a nice amount of content, and it looks like you've already taken the time to build some useful PHP applications (like your image gallery). So good job for that!
Ok - how about this:

Teams can donate any money - if they want to.
All teams are eligible regardless of if they pay.
Prizes are still 35% and 15% of the money we receive in donations.
Uploading appears to be working no problem now.  Go for it if you haven't lately. :cool:
Well i got it working i was messign with the code when i posted it so i accidently left stuff out.  Thanks Tex helped a lot.
that is one mind blowin' awesome robot...kudos man
Personally, I wouldn't make money an object at all. How about having the teams that win have pride in what they did, instead of doing it for a reward?

Do you get any money for winning a regional or nationals? No, you get pride, which is all anyone truely needs. There is albsolutely no reason to have money involved in this besides personal gain. But, that's my opinion.
I have an old IBM 365XD. Since its february vacation, a few friend and myself have decided to have a little fun with it. I don't use it for anything, the computer I use is this hp. I plan on just completely deleting the whole thing and switching (from windows 95) to Linux and opensource. I figured it would speed the machine up and it would probably be a good maneuver because IBM is converting to Linux right now anyways.
I personally think that some of the critical statements are over taken or taken the wrong way and or blown way out of poportion.  i am not in any way shape or forum dissagreeing with the big man andy on his post, i agree with it =D, but ithink that someof it some of what is said can be just taken the wrong way.  i still do think though some people can tone down the way they come out from thier posts...

and i completely agree with zach p... that last part is VERY very intriguing =D

*edit* also... by the way... i do not want to sound mean, or arguative or anything... but why does one individual impact a team?  i mean it could be some freshman trying to make a joke and trying to act cool, and most of the time a team does not agree with one another also... so... can someone clairify this for me please...
really now guys,(and girls) what did you expect?
Ok - All monetary prizes have been removed.
Don't get me wrong, I don't want to come off sounding like a bad guy here, even though most of the time I do. I think this is a great idea, and have seen it done before on various other sites with great work submitted. I just feel in the spirit of FIRST there is no need to have money involved in anyway.
Which is the best version of linux to use. I want to make the transition on my old 365XD laptop just because removing the excess code would seem like the machine would fly... i'm at a standoff right now in which version is best. Redhat, Gentoo, mandrake?
i have little idea of what we are doing... but i think we are going to try to knock both over and hope the mover goal is on our side. and get that once autonomous is over... but thats just a guess from what ive seen =D
This can be another way that teams get money (as in, to participate in FIRST) - that's all I'm saying.
I just voted intel because i've never used amd.
I realize that, but do you see where I'm coming from? I'm no against fund raising, I'm against fund raising where teams, for whatever reason, keep a portion of the proceeds.
How can it be fundraising if a team does not keep a portion of the funds raised?
just learned about it in psychology (knew that class was good for somethin), and its really just about having the support of your peers means more to most people than anything else. Having one person on these forums say something bad about their robot can be very demoralizing and the opposite is true.

Not that much on topic but in a study when canadian college students were asked what was the most tramautic event in their childhoold only 9% mentioned their parents while 37% mentioned something peer related. (from the psych book lol)


I want to congratulate not just on your fine work on this year's robot, but also your courage to leap to a newer level not many people in FIRST have thought of.  "we understand that we can learn from each other and put both teams' experience to create a better program for our students."




Ditto.

And thanks to 60 for warmly and generously sharing their plans from a past robot arm with us this year. There were new members on our team that didn't believe 60 would say yes to our request. My husband and I, of course, were confident they would. They did with bells on. It helped open some team members' eyes about the possilibities of coopetition between teams.
While the FIRST experience is based on Gracious Professionalism and inspiration, and I have no doubt that each and every member of teams 60 and 254 have been somehow enlightened or otherwise inspired by their building experience, much like every other FIRST team, I believe that other aspects are key, chief among those being team-building.  The members of an individual FIRST team, who go through all of the ups and downs of build alongside each other, will perhaps benefit in ways that the members of collaborating teams wouldn't.  But then again, I am neither a member of team 60 nor team 254, so my opinion is relatively inconsequential.  Just a slight comparison, though:  Corporate outsourcing.
I'd really like to be involved with political science. Either writing columns as a journalist or being a political analyst. Thats just the stuff that really interests me. I've never been good at math or anything so I searched for something that interested me. I like this and I understand it.
You said for other teams to raise money. Why should you're team keep the majority of the profit generated?

Also, I doubt many teams would enter if they have to pay an entry fee.
Pepperoni Pizza.

Star Wars or Star Trek?
We were at school from 1PM until 7PM yesterday.  Then we went to "Chris' Full Service Garage" where we worked until 2AM and got the robot nearly complete.
How about 75% they keep 25% us. We need funds too...

And the fees would be like 10 to 20 dollars.
Its been a bit of time since anyone's replied to this...but i really like the sony vaio. I'd beef it up with as much memory and speed as possible...22 inch lcd...i'd only use it for music and video editing (haha...i know that fits in the mac category but i'd rather stick to pc).
If you need funds, try getting your community involved. Have a car wash, pancake breakfast or something else. Granted these are suggestions. If you wanna do this, go ahead by all means, I was just voicing my opinion. Community involvement is a big part of FIRST also.
im kinda interested in engineering but i dont know if i want to do it for a livving. this fall i'm going to school for fire science.
True.

Actually, I've seen less negativity this year than last year. (maybe I have not been reading enough...)
I felt last year was the worst. I remember it got really ugly at some moments.....

Even KenL had to criticize some of the CD members for virtual mud slinging.
:rolleyes:


if( (p1_wheel & 0xC0) == 0xC0 )



"&" is the "bitwise AND" operator. that means that it looks at individual bits of a value, and does an AND operation. AND is defined as follows: true if both inputs are true, otherwise false. a logic table:

0, 0 = 0
1, 0 = 0
0, 1 = 0
1, 1 = 1

so as you can see, it will only return 1's in the places where both numbers have ones. thus, it will only return all of the bits of one value if the same bits are 1's in the other value. the if statement essentially checks to see that all of the bits that are 1 in 0xC0 are also 1 in p1_wheel. replace 0xC0 with whatever "bitmask" (set of bits) you want to test as being 1.
Yo, Daver... happy freakin birthday. ;)
See you in a few weeks.


really now guys,(and girls) what did you expect?





MORE MORE!!!! we want MORE!!!! =D &lt;3


I'm very confused as to what the whole mechanism at the top is.

It's a pnuematic that is rotated by the window motor, but what does it do and why is it attatched with zip ties and what's with the glove? There's more to come I hope.



actually the reason for the glove might have something to do with the "why is it there"

**why zip ties**
we are waiting for some BIMBA D-241 (i think) brackets.

**3 major hints eh?**
the motors were one.

**It appears that you are using both the drills and both the cims for your drivetrain.**
yup

**The pnuematics in the middle look like they are for some sort of wings to help herd the balls.**
the subject of that sentence is way off, the other half is right, although not shown in the pic


This pretty funny.  Maybie the picture is more deceiving than i thought it would be when i posted it.


It's proof.  Aliens are real and they have invaded 294.  After winning Chairman's Award by controlling the judges with their mind control goo, they will come for me and the secret plans they have marked in my hair.





LOL!!! My mind wanders with all the possibilities...
13 and 15 would probably come from the code for single-joystick navigation in the default program.
omg... omg... omg...

it took me about 2 min to re-coop from this awsome beauty... the colors are just awsome... the fabrication looks outstanding!!!

so... can it do more than look pretty?! =D


Make a scene.  Have particles chase a target.  Once successful, have them chase another target at random in the scene.  Do that without a script and with one event.  I want to know how!




I would, but right now im too busy with our animation. I'm not sure what exactly you mean by "one event", but YES, i can make such scene with a single particle system, controlled from one place. Particle Flow is the best addition in 3dsmax6, after mental ray.
Happy Birthday Dave!
DJ, Jeff, you guys definatly took my post in the wrong direction...

i was in no way "team bashing" as i was accused of. i was simply stating a fact that some teams arent so lucky to get a decent team, much less two. all i was trying to say is people arent too happy about the pairting, and i was just stating that. no need to give me negative rep points for stating a fact.
How much does that weigh? Your use of metal seems very effiecent
Last year we named our left and right programs NOOPS and KROF...now start figuring out which was which!

Also, I too cannot make strange names. However, the sonnet thing sounds like a fun idea. Then when I am gone, the others can learn through sonnets. Its shakespear and robotics...come together!
Everyone is forgetting that this is the northeast! It could be anywhere from -10 to 75!!! I'd suggest dressing warm though. You're better off being warm than cold.
It's hard to predict what the weather is going to be in a months time. By the way the North East has been lately, I would suggest dressing warmly, looking at temperatures probably between 40F-60F, but it's still a month away. This is based on how the winter and weather have been recently though.
Congratulations on this well deserved award.
As an alumni of team 166, I have experienced firsthand John Bugeau's enthusiasm toward and love of FIRST, the students involved, and science and technology in general.  John Bugeau's continued support and involvement has encouraged and inspired not only the Merrimack and Nashua teams, but all the teams that receive support from BAE systems, and more importantly the current NH LEGO league participants who are the future of FIRST in NH.

Thank you for inspiring me personally.  John allowed me the opportunity, not only to develop and utilize my skills in those areas related to FIRST, but also to live out a dream and an amazing experience unrelated to FIRST by allowing me to sing at the BAE Regional.  Thank you so much for that opportunity.  It meant the world to me.

Thank you for your dedication to students, FIRST, and science and technology.  You have inspired so many people, and helped bring to life so many dreams both related and unrelated to FIRST.  Congratulations again on this incredible honor that you deserve.

I would definitely recommend going for a not so userfriendly distribution, but not one that is extremely difficult for new users (gentoo, LFS).  I find that slackware is just right: not difficult to install, but doesn't do everything for you like mandrake does.  Personally, I use Slack 9.1 on my main computer (kernel 2.6.0), Vector 4 on my server (2.4.22 i believe... gotta get around to updating that to at least 2.4.24...), and Fedora Core 2 on my laptop (2.6.2).  Fedora is the first rpm based distro I have used, and so far it is pretty nice.

also, as ............... said, your choice of windowmanager will make a big impact on your opinion... but what you chose depends on your tastes; if you are used to normal explorer on windows, then i would use either kde or gnome because they are very similiar to explorer.  if you already use bb4win or litestep, then you may be more comfortable using something like blackbox, enlightenment, or pekwm.

also, if you do dualboot, use windows as an absolute last resort.  in fact, the way that i learned linux was by deleting windows. you see, i love my computer so much that i was forced to figure out how to get things working the way they should be... if i had windows installed, i probably would have just given up sometimes and gone back to using it. a few years using solely linux, i have never looked back on the switch.
I really do not know what to take of all this.  It technically seems as if FIRST rules don't rule this out but it also seems a bit unfair.  If you're going to pair up, why don't one of you take a rookie team under your wing and show them the ropes?  Why take two, experienced veteran teams and make one robot essentially, just copied.  FIRST is about gracious profesionalism, but it also is a competition...FIRST Robotics Competition, as the title says right [here.](http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/)

Competition-  A test of skill or ability; a contest.

How is having something done for you a test of skill?  Why compete if you're perfectly matched?  I understand working together, assisting and all, but building whole components for each other...seems a bit unfair.  Wouldn't everyone learn more in the end if you made your own robot?  Ok, one team may be experts in drive trains, the other in appendages.  Well, how are the teams supposed to grow and learn and advance their knowledge if they have others do it all for them?  It, overall, is a very unique idea but still shakey in my book.  Just...wow.
AMD all the way.  On computer I have now, I saved about $200 by going with the AMD chipset.  It may run a little hotter, but I don't care..I run my computer with the side off anyway.  I have an AMD T-Bird 950MHz at home and am running an AMD 3000+ on my computer.

A memory map can be generated by MPLAB whenever you compile your code. You have to turn it on by going to Project -&gt; Build Options... -&gt; Project then click on the "MPLINK Linker" tab, then click on "Generater map file". After you build your project look in the project directory for a text file ending in ".map" just a little way down the file it will have a section that looks like:



Program Memory Usage
Start         End
---------   ---------
0x000800    0x000837
0x0008d4    0x0033d8
0x0033da    0x003511
0x300000    0x30000d
11395 out of 33816 program addresses used, program memory utilization is 33%




This gives you the program or rom space used. For the data or ram space it's a little harder. After the section above all space used will be listed by address. You'll see your familiar variables listed. You have to check the maximum addresses used by the data portion of your code.


e.g.,
I   0x0007b7       data     static C:\mcc18\Projects\FrcCode\FrcCode\ifi_library.c
count   0x0007b8       data     static C:\mcc18\Projects\FrcCode\FrcCode\ifi_library.c
temp   0x0007b9       data     static C:\mcc18\Projects\FrcCode\FrcCode\ifi_library.c






Thanks for this info Mark!  This is helpful.  I've just been looking at the .map file for my latest build and trying to calculate how much RAM I'm using up.  I looked in the .map file in the section where it's sorted by address and noticed something interesting:




Symbols - Sorted by Address
Name    Address   Location    Storage File
---------  ---------  ---------  --------- ---------
__tmp_0   0x000000     data     static D:\Code\Comp\v1\ifi_utilities.c
...
nullStr   0x0007da        data     extern D:\Code\Comp\v1\printf_lib.c
RCSTA2   0x000f6b      data     extern C:\FIRST\SRC\PROC\p18f8520.asm
...
TOSU   0x000fff          data     extern C:\FIRST\SRC\PROC\p18f8520.asm




I put the "..." in there to condense the info.  But the interesting thing is the transition from C variables to assembly variables.  The C variables occupy 2010 bytes of memory (0x000000 up to 0x0007da).  Then there's a bunch of empty space from 0x0007db on up to 0x000f6a, and then the assembly variables occupy 0x000f6b up to 0x000fff.  There are 4095 (FFF) bytes of RAM available in total, but it looks like all the IFI assembly defs and unions occupy the last 148 bytes from 0x000f6b up to 0x000fff.

To truly measure how many bytes you're using, you have to take the hex difference between the first assembly variable address (in all cases I think this will be 0x000f6b) and the last C variable address (in my case 0x0007da).  Convert this number to decimal and subtract it from 4095 and the result is how many bytes of RAM your code uses.

It's also worth keeping in mind then that we really have 3946 bytes (up to 0x000f6a) of useable RAM since the IFI assembly stuff reserves the last 148 bytes.  It will be hard to use that much RAM, but it's still worth noting.
i would suggest that instead of arguing over this right now, you should go and build your robot.

what is done is done! PERIOD!

if you are lowering the speed of both motors, then you will also be lowering the torque coming out of both motors, because to lower the speed, you have to lower the power going into them.




yeah...i understand but what i'm trying to say is that if both motors are going the same speed /force relative to each other if they oppose in direction they will produce more output torque ...

It may be too late for that at this point.  Numerous questions about this venture have been brought up, and need to be addressed in a official manner.  Expect some sort of ruling from FIRST in the near future.  Although, I highly doubt that either team would be barred from competition.

On the other hand, there is still that cryptic comment on the first page of Team Update #10.  It's already been addressed earlier in this thread, but it warrants consideration.  FIRST was hinting that they had seen something that was creative, deserving of recognition, yet illegal.  This may have been what they were talking about.

The next few days should be interesting, to say the least.  Then again, isn't that always true about the last week of build season?

Better then I can do :) Kudos!
**i have a question for everyone...

Would anyone care if 2 rookie teams pared up to help each other...?

What if 60 and 254 werent well known teams and pared up to improve themselves...would so many people be avidly against "coopertition" then?**
What do you guys think of our robot?


this is the section of the rulebook that is going to be the problem for these two teams, and I dont see anything grey about it:

5.2.5 Design and Build Rules
&lt;R09&gt; Teams must fabricate and/or assemble all custom parts and assembled mechanisms on the robot by the
2004 team after the start of the Kick-off. Mechanisms from previous year’s robots may not be used,
however, individual off-the-shelf components from previous year’s robots may be re-used to save the cost
of re-purchase of these parts IF they meet ALL of the 2004 Additional Parts and Materials Rules.


I hope these two teams work out some sort of agreement with FIRST, so they can compete - but I also home FIRST makes it clear that collaboration on this level is not in the spirit of FIRST.





Ken, will you exlpain to me how this is going to be an issue... I am in need of a little clafirication.


And I would like to say the following.  Please don't hold any of it against, me I'm not trying to be rude.

As a member of Team 60, I am used to the constant whiplash of the design of our robot.  If we are not knocked down at least once a year for our design, it is a very rare occurrence.  I do not hold any grudges, because I also realize that some of our alumni have acted in an undignified and very ungracious manner.
Teams had every right to be upset.
Now, however, we have done a lot to improve both our reputation and the spirit of FIRST.  We are mentoring two teams in Arizona, eight LEGO league teams, we help out whenever we are asked.  Gladly.

This alliance is the next step.  Our CAD drawings for this year's robot, any past robot, strategies (from game strategy to marketing strategy to team organization) have been available fully and completely to those that ask.

We did NOT create this alliance to push down any other team.  The parts were student machined.  All labor was donated.  When we were designing, we were desingning together.  When we were building, we did as much, if not more than other teams.

And it IS a real life solution to the problem.  If an engineering company has to team up with another company to produce a product, they both put in man hours and they both put in the effort.  I've seen it happen in REAL LIFE. At Laron, no less.

As I said before, do not think less of me.  This is my third year on this team, and I have been educated this year, far more than the last two combined.

PS Dima, darling, we love you, but I don't think this will end without much of a fight.


**i have a question for everyone...

Would anyone care if 2 rookie teams pared up to help each other...?

What if 60 and 254 werent well known teams and pared up to improve themselves...would so many people be avidly against "coopertition" then?**



Though I support our team and team 254, I don't really think that is important actually I agree with dima, what more is there to say?
Just to correct a much much earlier statement. Our robots are the same exactly except the wiring. that is to say the same wires go to the same places they are just arranged differently. both teams will be able to use programs from the other team. all parts and programs are interchangeable

on another note, interchangeable parts revolutionized the world and that pretty much compares to this.


Though I support our team and team 254, I don't really think that is important actually I agree with dima, what more is there to say?





Solex.  That's completely your personality.  haha! Through all of this I never thought ONE OF OUR OWN would say such a thing!

It makes me laugh! :D

We built a microwave.  You built a toaster.

I cannot use the parts from my microwave in my toaster.  I don't think the comparison is remotely valid.

*In response to a later reply:*
While it may be true that certain components are shared between toasters and microwaves, the parts from one cannot be used in the other in any practical sense.  The resistors capacitors, nuts, bolt and screws that you'll find in both the toaster and the microwave are analogous to our speed controllers, robot controller and pneumatic systems -- our kit of parts.

The heating coils from my toaster serve no purpose in a microwave oven.  Likewise, the microwave's timer isn't too useful on a toaster.  These are unique systems that were designed to best suit their products; though each product is designed to accomplish the same goal -- to prepare food.

FIRST robots are kitchen appliances.  In the end, they all score points just as all appliances help to feed us.  Through your collaboration, however, I now have two toasters and no microwave.  The students on teams 60 and 254 are now highly efficient at making toast, but did anyone learn how to use the microwave?

actually you most likely could. you would need more parts but you could still use some.


What do you guys think of our robot?




It's nice to see an old school ball hopper show up on CD once more :)  Good job!


Does anyone know where I can find specs (specifically the dimensions) of the female PWM cable connectors?


From the [magical FAQ](http://kevin.org/frc/faq.html):

**Q: Which connectors did you use to connect to the robot controller?
**A: If you really, really want to build your own cables and haven't consumed any caffeine in the last week, use Amp connector housing P/N 530554-2 and female contact P/N 530553-5. [Digi-Key](http://www.digikey.com/) has 'em. Search on P/N 530554-2-ND for the connector housing and P/N 530553-5-ND for the contacts. If you decide to build cables using this connector, make sure you have a good set of needle-nose pliers for crimping. I also recommend a very small dab of solder for a good connection.

-Kevin
right now, if a strong breeze blew through our shop i doubt our robot would remain standing..
but hopefully it'll get stronger
I can't remember exactly, but I thought the PWM cables that FIRST gave us had a chamfer on one of the corners and possibly a tab on the short side so that they can't be inserted in the wrong orientation.  Is my memory leaving me or am I right.  If the cable connectors do in fact have those features, does anyone have dimensions on them.  BTW, thanks for those specs.

Okay, so you've got two toasters... from what? This analogy doesn't completely make sense (although I like where you went with it).

If your goal is to make a toaster, make a toaster.  We set out to make the SAME thing.  It's not like we went out to change our robot into something completely different.  We weren't trying to transform "toasters into microwaves"  we just wanted to work together.
*this is my opinion and does not represent team 60 as a whole*

I was a driver last year for team 60 and also our alliance team stratagist. I heard alot about our team both negative and positive because of this. I understand that this may seem unfair to alot of people but our intention was never to try to gain any sort of unfair advantage. Yes we are looking for an advantage but so is every other team and this did not seem unfair to us. I am not saying that we are the almighty judges of what is right or wrong but if we felt it was wrong we wouldn't have done it. I agree that FIRST does need to make a ruling that is more clear, not because i think we are wrong but becasue this is way to much drama to have. I have heard from other teams that we constantly try to twist the rules and make them what we want but that is not true. We may go into grey areas but challenging something is the only way to make it better. We do not go out each year trying to think of ways to piss off other teams as i have also heard. To the best of my knowledge we have never turned down a request for help( i may be wrong because this is only my second year). As mentioned earlier we are mentoring 2 robotics teams as well as 8 lego leauge teams and have given away drawings to teams and any other way we can help. Personally i think if we can make every team as good as we try to be then that makes the competition all that much more fun and competitive. As far as maching issues I can guarantee that all parts were made by students becasue we have to make schedules becasue so many of us want to build as much as possible.

i don't know if this made any sense to many people but these are just random thoughts i was having about this topic. sorry for the spelling but i am really bad at it. math is more of my strong point.
something else i saw in another post although i don't think may people saw it.
what if you had divisions for FIRST like you do in High School Sports (5A, 4A and so on) the only problems i see with this is that i don't think there are enough teams to split it up much plus it might break down relationships with other teams since they might be in a different division. It would also lead to teams thinking they are better or worse then others.

the point of this post in this thread is that it would solve the rookie part of this argument
Man!  That Curious Ken never learns!  Curiousity killed the cat.. hopefully not the monkey too!

Maybe he's just trying to get a little closer to that gear box.. it looks mighty pretty :-)

**No monkeys were harmed in the making of this teaser**
Collaboration does not necessarily deny competition. Say we wanted to go to Mars. We could compete with kingman, each of us trying to get there first. Sure, at least one of us would get there. But what if we teamed up, to achieve our common goal even faster? This is all our relationship is. Two teams, one goal - creation of not only a good robot, but maybe more importantly, life lessons in teamwork and communication.

Putting all other issues aside, I think KenW is just trying to address the issue of the letter of the rule, and that is, the robot can only use parts build by your own team, and parts that isn't built by your own team is limited by the $3500 rule.  So, it is OK if you use parts not build by your own team, as long as they are within the $3500 limit.  Otherwise it is against the rules.

I have a feeling that it would've been ok if your two team designed the robot together, but manufactured it separately.  After all, people use other's designs all the time.  It is a part of engineering.  Just look at so many teams benefiting from technokat's transmission design.  But when another team is building some part of your robot for you, then it is not your work.  What's made by Bellarmine is Bellarmine's work, and what's made by Kingman is Kingman's work.  No matter how strong the partnership is, you are still 2 teams entering the competition under two names.  But FIRST didn't say that's not allowed, they addressed this with the $3500 rule.  It is ok to use parts made by others as long as you count the cost of making it.  But I think that's FIRST's call. I have a feeling they haven’t considered this when they wrote the rule.

I have been there all the years when Kingman's robot designs were challenged every year.  And from time to time, your team suffer not because a decision was made on the issue, but the fact that FIRST change their ruling from events to events.  That is something I do not wish to see happening this year.  Your team deserves a fair review and a fair decision.  And you deserve that decision at ALL events.  In fact, I would recommend your team talk to FIRST about this, ask them to make a decision, and make sure ALL the FIRST staffs running the regionals you are going to KNOW that decision.  And make sure you get a FINAL decision from FIRST so they won’t change it.


And Amanda, I think no one who has read this thread will think less of you, or hold anything against you.  You have done a tremendous job representing your team and its image.  You were very well spoken in your post, and because of that, the posts I've seen in this thread is much more level-headed and thought through than most I've seen in the past.  Keep up the good work.  It is under these stressful times when you should keep a leveled head at all time.  Be profoundly understanding of other’s point of view, but stand your ground if you believe it’s a right one.  Good luck with the challenges ahead of you and your team.
It looks like it could handle about 14....
I hate to be an i told you so but it is apparent to me it has occurred once again that hopefully it won't turn out for the worse as in truck town thunder's case.....someone asked why do you or do you not share your design during the build season?.....this thread case & point....

as far as the design sharing goes i like it, identical robot production im not completely for....frankly im not interested in the communication aspect of it....i communicate fine with heatwave and other teams in florida bouncing ideas off them and vice versa....i don't go and outsource my work to heatwave or anyone else. I don't believe anyone on either of the two teams was thinking of the 3500 limit in the manner described on this thread because that rule operates in such a grey area, but i also do not believe they were trying to subvert any of the rules....one or two subsystem collaboration i see as ok, but the robots are twins (and please don't hand me that story about programming and minor modification you contradict yourself by saying if one wins a design award the other team takes pride in it...they are either seperate designs or the same, in this situation you can't have it both ways or you are just lying to yourself)

great idea, but maybe taken a bit too far....hopefully this can be allowed in this one particular case (so that these teams that did put a good # of hours of work into this can compete), but FIRST should wiegh in on it (on either side) for future situations....you want to ask yourself should a sponsor be allowed to dump super machining time into their robots & make 16 chief delphis therefore increasing their overall chances of winning? i don't think so, but that is up to FIRST to decide

basically i sum it all up this way: this year let this go, but it should be addressed for the future situations and make a more clear defintion of sponsor so there is no confusion (do the have to be in the name? do they have to be on the shirt? are they a sponsor if they give you a huge discount on their stuff?)
I wish people would stop picking on "celebrety" teams

I KNOW for a fact that if i wanted to i could go out and find something on most of the teams, no matter how little this thing would be, and start a thread just like this one on it! But I dont because it dont want to HURT other teams. People who bash 60 and 254 in this tread (or any other team for that matter) WANT to HURT those teams. I dont think thats graciously profecional.


P.S. if you guys want other teams to post teasers (or anything else about thier bots) in the future, you should seriously re think what you are doing here. Remember some thing CAN NOT be undone!

very impressive

did you make all those models yourself?  :ahh:
looks simple and effective, i'm sure that'd be a good alliance partner for a lot of teams
There's one thing that has really irked me about this whole concept.

*We don't know what official stance FIRST will take, because nobody from either team took a few minutes to ask some simple questions on the FIRST Q&A at the start of the season.*

There's been controversey on rulings in the past, but since this situation involves finances, sponsorship, and some important definitions (**NOT game strategy**) it's a completely different ball game from what we've seen before.

Team members openly admitted that they knew that there would be critics... so I ask, why wouldn't you have a long list of Q&A's ready to fire back, showing what you did was completely within the rules?

Instead, FIRST is a really tough bind, and these teams need to potentially ask for forgiveness instead of ask for permission.

[edit /irresponsibility]

FIRST doesn't like to make rulings specifically because people ventured into a grey area without asking. This is why the Q&A system was set up, so that prompt answers could be read by all teams to both common and obscure, "grey area" questions.

**This is OBVIOUSLY a grey area.**

**I hope I'm wrong**, and a team leader will post a written ruling tomorrow from FIRST (dated 4 weeks ago) giving you the thumbs up to do this. If so, I sincerely have no qualms.

However, if some team leaders have risked the entire season for not one but two teams on this collaboration without asking FIRST the appropriate questions, I give my deepest sympathy to all of the students that may end up with a ruined season. I hope it won't come to that. It looks like a lot of people have worked long and hard, and it would be a shame if FIRST, out of fairness to all teams, had to make a ruling that was unexpected.

However, this situation should be ruled as though this question was asked before the season started. The idea of bending the rules and definitions because something has "already been done" is fundamentally unfair to all other FIRST teams.

Just my two cents,

Matt
For the most part, we've stayed out of this discussion for a couple reasons:

1. Because while others make assumptions - we know what we we've done, we know how hard we work and how much we contribute to the FIRST community
2. Because all we are "guilty" of is hiding nothing, sharing our partnership, and sharing our resources with as many FIRST teams as we can


Many are making assumptions without any factual understanding to back up their claims. So let us try to provide some background info (our apologies for the length, as this may be long because it’s a combination of thoughts many of our team members share, and we don't want to make any personal attacks or offend anyone)

Our team (254) was the smallest team in the country in 1999, had no funds, no facility to build, and no power tools.  I wasn't on the team then (this is my third year), but I have learned our history and am proud of it.  It has taken our team 6 very hard years to secure the facility and resources we have.  Each year we have gotten a little bigger, a little more experience, and secured some more resources.  We currently have just one engineer on our team (that's right - one), two college students (who are alumni and have been on our team for 4 years), two teachers who help organize the team but have basically no robot knowledge (Sorry Mr. Urhausen and Mr. Gonzalez), and one machinist who volunteers to help us, and our engineers wife who gives a lot of time to help us.  No adult on our team can program, no adult helps our animation team, our website team is entirely students, and our students work endlessly to build our robot.

Kingman (60) has no engineers.  They have two machinists (Glenn and George), one teacher, a sheriff, and I think one other mentor with I think a Business degree if I remember correctly.  They have 15-20 students who work with their mentors to build and program the robot each year.  What's Kingman guilty of?  Powder Coating their robot and making it look great each year - that's all.  And because they do, some teams like to assume they have 5-10 engineers and that Ford builds their robot.  When in reality, that team works hard each year, their students are as involved as most students on any FIRST team, their students learn a tremendous amount from just a couple dedicated mentors, and worst of all - does anyone reading this think that any team who has criticized Kingman over the years would themselves turn down a sponsor who offered to powder coat their robot once they built it?  Of course not, we'd all love to do it - and Kingman inspired us to go out and find a local company to help us powder coat our robot this year.

How many of you can name well known "powerhouse" teams who have 10-20 mentors and engineers?  How many of you can name many "powerhouse" teams who have professional programmers who do all or most of their programming?  How many of you can name "powerhouse" teams who have much more experience than 60 or 254, and until the last couple years always had slicker looking robots than either of them?  Even working together, the resources of 60 and 254 don't even come close to the resources of many other teams in FIRST.  You've never seen us criticize those teams - instead we look at them as model teams - we're happy for them that they have so much support and hope they inspire other teams to continue to build their programs stronger.  We're proud of the fact that we started at the "bottom" (I've heard stories about how intimidated and overwhelmed our team, with $6k and no tools, was when they saw the teams from Delphi, Motorola, and GM in 1999 and 2000 - how they were convinced there was no way they could ever compete with those teams.  Thankfully they didn't whine about it, give up, quit, or stop working hard - or myself and my friends might not have a team to participate on right now).  And we're proud that we've proven teams can build each year, get stronger each year, and compete with low or high resource teams no matter where they may fall in the spectrum.

Everyone is acting like this is some kind of guarantee that a better robot is going to be built.  Deep inside, I think everyone knows that no unbeatable robot can be built this year – that the winning teams are going to need great strategy, great driving, good human players, great alliance partners, and a little or a lot of luck – as always. Sometimes a collaboration of teams may help each other do better, sometimes they may not – it’s not like there’s any guarantee.  Normally no one knows for sure which ideas will be the best, and it’s very possible (if not probable – like every year) that we will realize a month from now that one of the ideas our team had but discarded might have been better.

Some talk about how teams shouldn't venture into that 'grey area'. But isn't that how progress is gained? By venturing into uncharted territory and pushing the envelope? We know that something like this has never been done, and we expected this to be an innovative test which many would be curious to see how it worked out. However, we are confident that FIRST will agree that this type of collaboration is in line with the ideals of the organization. Our leaders have done nothing, and never would, put our season or our team at any "risk" - and our teams are in no "danger" as you put it.  There's no rule against it, it's that simple. How many times have Dean and Woody encouraged teams to work together and share ideas?

Our team has been very blessed to do well every year – our team has won at least one Regional all five years we’ve been in FIRST and has made the Championship playoffs each year, and done well.  Kingman has done pretty much just as well.
For this kind of success, a number of things have to happen – the teams have to be good, have to build good robots, have to work well with other teams, need to have good partners, and need to have a little luck.  Some years our team had good robots – but in every event we enter we know that the “odds” are that we won’t win and that all those things have to happen for us even to have a chance.  The “odds” are that neither of our teams will win an event this year – but even if we do, is anyone really going to claim it was because we worked together?  In the best possible world, all we could hope for it to do “as well” as we have done totally alone not working together – we don’t have any “need” to work together, we decided we wanted to.  Why can’t people get that?  So if/when we lose events this year, please give credit to those teams who beat us – they would have beat us with or without our partnership with Kingman, and they deserve the credit.  And if our team wins an event, we will be proud that our drivers and strategists performed so well, and if 60 wins we’ll cheer for them because we’re happy for them and because they are good people.  If anyone thinks Kingman couldn’t or wouldn’t have won without us, or the other way around, then they need to look at the past 5 years to be proven wrong.

Like Dave Lavery has said, please stop being lawyers and start building robots.  Our teams decided this partnership months ago.  We made no attempts to hide it – one of our students and a 60 mentor even traveled all the way to LA in September to show off the drive system we jointly designed and built over the summer – showing over 30 teams and 300 FIRST people everything (transmissions, gears, plans).  We tested the robot at the Cal Games in October and even named the team “Bionic Poofs” so everyone knew our teams were working together.  Was Laron a 254 sponsor last year or NASA Ames a 60 sponsor last year?  No.  But we both agreed to sponsor the other team months ago, and have had three common sponsors this entire year.  Their info is on our website (going up this week – been totally redesigned by our web students) and Laron was already listed as a sponsor our t-shirts already being printed.  So if anyone thinks either of our teams didn’t make our intentions, plans, and sponsorships crystal clear and totally within the FIRST rules way before this sad thread started, please know that any such accusation or hint is quite untrue.

Our team has mentored rookie teams 4 of the past 6 years.  We have provided workshops at the WRRF sessions for hundreds of participants.  We helped start the Cal Games and help support it each year.  We open our facility up to ANY teams in the area who wish to come use it.  We have provided the majority of the volunteers for two FLL tournaments in San Jose and Northern California the past few years.  We hold a pre ship scrimmage on our field each year and spend the weekend helping any local team in need to get their robot running.  Last year, our team found out that the Sacramento Regional would not have a machine shop.  We decided not to attend a third regional (Arizona) and decided to spend our funds to build a mobile shop in a trailer – which we didn’t build until the week AFTER we had shipped our robot.  We took that trailer to Sacramento, San Jose, and the Championship (when FIRST said they needed more machine shop help) and made almost 300 repairs on robots – including the 3 that beat us in Sacramento.  And we’re going to do it again this year instead of going to a third regional.  Do we have to help all the teams we do?  No.  Do we have to spend a big portion of our budget supporting and helping other teams in FIRST who aren’t as fortunate as us?  No.  We do it because we want to.  We do it because our team knows how hard it’s been for us to get those resources and we want to share them.  We do it because other teams have set great examples and showed us how special it is when teams help each other and work together.  We do it because our mentors have probably been brainwashed by Dean and Woody and have convinced us that we should feel good about helping others have a good experience, even though we know we could have built better robots if we put all our resources into just our own team.

From what I know, Glenn on Kingman goes to LA to give workshops to all the Southern California teams each year.  Kingman created an incredible fundraising support packet which they made available to allFIRST teams on their website and also gave workshops to Arizona teams.  Kingman provides the entire machine shop for the Arizona Regional for free – and they’re over two hours away – they drive the machines there at Laron’s cost and not the Regionals.  And some people have implied that our team or Kingman should share some of their resources with other teams?

What’s the result of some of these posts – veteran teams should only help other teams “a little”, but not enough to help keep compete at the same level?  We should just give little pieces of info and assistance to teams, but always hold back key thoughts and knowledge so that we are guaranteed to be better?  Sorry, we don’t feel that way, that’s just our opinion.  Our engineer has mentioned how impressed he was that Team 45 shared their innovative transmission with other teams and even offered to give/make the transmissions for some teams – we were impressed they would share ideas with everyone and help others get better.  We were impressed that some of the “swerve” teams helped some teams create a “swerve” bot last year, even though they wouldn’t make much of the information available to everyone.  At least they helped some teams – better than none.
Is anyone criticizing those teams who go to four or five events, when they could be spending some of those extra funds to help teams in need?  Anyone criticizing the teams who have 10-20 engineers and professional programmers doing a majority of their work when they could be spreading the support out to a number of local teams or they could be helping to recruit and start rookie teams so more students could experience FIRST?

We don’t criticize any of those teams, because it doesn’t matter – they do what’s best for their team.  If we decide to help others, that’s our choice.  Our few mentors have taught us that we can only control what our team decides to do, that worrying/whining about what other teams do and if they have more money or engineers than us doesn’t change our situation or make our robot get build any quicker.  We try our best each year, and at the same time have decided that we should do whatever we can to make our team successful, share our resources with other teams, and help as many other teams as we can – basically, we look at FIRST as constantly “raising the bar” on us, and we try to accept the challenge do the best we can to help us and other teams.

It is disappointing that both teams have had to defend ourselves so much. If every so called “powerhouse” team in FIRST shared their ideas, their resources, or their experience as much as our teams do – there would be few, if any, struggling teams in FIRST.  We don’t go around posting all we do for other teams – until know we’ve always let our actions speak for ourselves.  What’s really sad, is that it sounds like many teams will actually be rooting for our teams to “lose” just because we work together, share ideas and resources, and built a mutual respect and friendship.

For what it’s worth – all we do is try our best, and when we get beat we congratulate the other team and are happy for them, as we know how much work everyone puts into their team.  We don’t (and won’t) root against any other team, regardless of it you criticize us or not.  If we did, then we wouldn’t have learned a thing from being in FIRST.  No matter what, remember this…you can always bring your robot to our mobile shops any time, and we will always work our butts off to repair your bots, assist your teams, or donate spare parts.  If you would never help our team if we needed it and your team ever needs help, whether you like us or not, come by our pit area, and we’ll help your team in any way we can.  And even though we shouldn’t speak for them, we’re sure Kingman feels the same way and would help your team also.

We wish you all the best with your robots and hope you all have a great season.
A           (argh - can't put only one letter)
OK people.  Let's just settle this with a classic Drinks on me on Friday night.  I will buy each of you in this thread a drink when I see you at competition.

Oh wait, I forgot poor college students cannot afford drinks for 200 people.  ^^;  I guess I just won't show up to any this year then.

All jokes aside, I want to thank all of you for your thoughts in the posts (especially the last one by phrozen solyd, even I have to bow down to the length of that post).

I have been chating with another moderator about this, and we are both concerned that this will turn into another flaming war like many other threads in the past.  Originally I keep this open hopping people can have an intelligent, open discussion about this touchy issue.  So far 90% of the posts are doing that, which is good.  But we DO NOT want to see any more negative attitudes show up in this thread.

We've allowed a chance for both side to state their points.  We ask that you maintain this level of quality in your future message if you want to discuss the issue further.  Accusations and claims without evidences are not welcomed to this forum.  Any point you are going to make please back it up with justification.

A big part of this discussion exist in the form of a debate.  But that doesn't mean you should try to break each other's defense and tear their argument apart.  Sometimes you just have to agree to disagree.

Let us keep our cool, and enjoy this program as much as possible.  I have faith that all of you will make it all right again.

Also, it would be nice if off topic chats are kept in the form of PMs or e-mails.  It's nice to talk about microwave and toasters, but I think we can do without them.  Thanks :-).


I hope these two teams work out some sort of agreement with FIRST, so they can compete - but I also home FIRST makes it clear that collaboration on this level is not in the spirit of FIRST.




Who are you to say what the spirit of FIRST is?

Why is everyone always out to undermine everyone else's hard work.

For everyone's information, last year at the Sacramento Regional, I remember seeing two robots that were darn near, if not exactly identical.  NO ONE EVER SAID A WORD ABOUT THEM!  Hmmm now why could this be?  Oh yeah, now I remember, they were rookie teams (or second year, I don't remember)  now why do people care about Kingman and Bellarmine?  I think I know the answer to that too.  Because they win, quite a bit, because they have lots of resources.

Many people view these two teams, and other teams like them as having TONS of money, and being totally engineer designed and built.  Many people become jealous of what they think is happening, and instead of trying to get to the same point, just getting bitter and spiteful.  I know for sure that that is not in the spirit of FIRST.  Just because certain teams consistantly make good looking and good performing robots doesnt mean that theyre terrible people.

I know a few years ago I used to be jealous of teams like 60 and 254.  Guess what.  A few years ago I didn't know much at all, and I certainly wasn't aware of the true meaning of FIRST, afterall, it was just a robot, and theirs was way better than mine, right?  I didnt know anyone on these teams either, and from my skewed perspective, they seemed as if they were the exact opposite of what they truly were.

Now, I know people on these teams, and what their teams truly are like, and it's nothing like I thought it was, or many of you may think it is.  Looking back, I can't say Im proud of how I felt, and I wonder how I could have ever even felt that way.

So many people are unaware of anything a FIRST team does besides compete.  Particularly in the case of "winning" teams, the winning tends to overshadow everything else that a team may do.  I wont even cite the numerous different things that these two teams in particular do for the FIRST community.  If anyone hasnt been convinced that their impressions are wrong, this certainly wont change that.

Dont you people have better things to do with your time in the middle of week six than sit here posting this crap about how this and that are illegal and not in the spirit of FIRST and blah blah blah.  It seems like nowadays everyone looks for something to criticize before they look for a positive point.  Stop being so jealous and strive to attain what you envy.

Stop picking on 60 and 254 because they win a lot.  They dont pick on you now do they?

Cory
this
Looks like some teams got thier robot done early and have time to monkey around. :D
that
It's got big balls. lol Our team has followed quite a similar path, we'll see how it turns out for us. Does your expand?
Because both 254 and 60 are small, but do manage to accomplish what they accomplish, shouldn't they be sharing this gift with struggling rookies who may be not-so-successful but in a similar situation?

Mentorship is key.
we have similar design. we can get 7-9 last time i saw. how are the balls raised up into the hopper?
9 am to 2:30 am now that is the real definiton of late night. We considered a late one 9 am to 9 pm, and there is only one late night to go.


Always,
the kid in the red hat


If you still have a copy of max 5 you can install both that and your copy of inventor on the c drive. you can go into max and under the plugin paths add the Autodesk Inventor folder (I think it's the bin folder you want but not positive). Add the subpaths. next time you boot up max 5 you should be able to import an iam straight in. save it as a max file (or export as 3ds) and open it in your copy of max 6.




This whole thread was about plugins not working on our computers, and alternative options.  Please read the thread next time, thanks.

Tyler - Yeah, the .IGES file was huge.. that's why the entire robot kept freezing Max on me, but I imported the drive, sub systems, etc. , and that worked.  Now we got the entire robot in Max and we're in the process of animating it.


Al,

Who did you talk to at FIRST that said the wiring diagram is the the rule, rather then a suggestion?




I alerted the engineer I spoke with at FIRST of all the confusion.  He agrees that this issue must be addressed.  They would rather answer in an official way for all teams to read and indicated that it is FIRST's intention to address your concerns via the Q&A later this week.  I can only tell you that in a previous conversation I was told that the electrical blueprint is the way to wire the robot using the parts or stated equivalents provided in the KOP.  I, as all of you, hope that some changes will be made in these rules but at this point the ground stud, the distro block, the four way maxi fuse block are all part of the equation and we are building our robot to those specs.
To Chakorules:  If you wired according to your diagram, it seems you have added more return wire than needed.  I would have run a #6 from the battery directly to the fuse panel ground stud as in years past.
For everyone: Even though I quote individual paragraphs from time to time, the manual is a complete document and needs to be read and referenced as such.  I take the electrical blueprint as the manual and the written doc as a description of additional detail to the blueprint.


a couple questions from a rookie team..

is it really BETTER to have them mounted on a non insulating surface?
is it better to have them mounted on a board that is easily deattachable from the robot?
is using velcro to mount each individual component a good idea?
is it not a good idea to mount them to our frame directly using velcro?(our frame is aluminum)
how easily accessible should they be?
is it a bad idea to need to flip the robot over to take out the battery?
has there been any accidents that you know of where any part excluding the motors and fuses had to be replaced completely due to any reason other than physical disturbances?
how what gets HOT? the motors..... the victors? well they already have fans on them...

well anyways, please tell us what is BAD. and what we need to worry about or what we need to be careful of or what has to be however (other than whats on the manual)

just don't want to do anything wrong! thanks!



Green Cactus,
You have a lot of good answers here, I am proud of all that responded.  For us, we have used velcro in the past but were living with the experience of the bad speed controllers of the mid 1990's.  For the past few years we have used perforated aluminum as a base, tywraps to hold things in place.  We space parts out when we can to help with heat buildup (everything gets hot, motors most of all.  Circuit breakers when they are continuously tripping too.)  Parts should be accessible, if you get into the finals you won't have a lot of time to replace stuff so you want to be able to change it out quick.  We have mounted our battery in a doored compartment under the robot for years.  So you have to turn it over to change it, so what, you can't drop it on the RC accidently from there.  If your wiring is insulated to begin with, you may not need to have the mounting surface insulated.  Wood and lexan weigh a ton but a lot of teams use those materials for construction.
Now I think it's time to close this thread. What more can be honestly said about this that is a new perspective?

Like it or not, all we can do now is wait and watch.
it looks good guys!  i've been wondering who is actually planning picking up the balls.  it will make an amazing partner.  good work
Finally, a robot to gather and disturibute balls! I thought the concept had been abandoned, but you brought hope back!
Another interesting file to take a look at is "18f8520user.lkr"

It's a script for the linker blocking off PIC memory. A bunch of the space is listed as PROTECTED and the highest unprotected address is END=0x7F3


How much does that weigh? Your use of metal seems very effiecent




The weight was into the red with the flux capacitor.

To Chakorules:  If you wired according to your diagram, it seems you have added more return wire than needed.  I would have run a #6 from the battery directly to the fuse panel ground stud as in years past.
[quote]

Al:
Thanks for your reply. If you have a ground lug in the KIT that certainly would have been the best way, lug on circuit breaker panel, to lug on ground lug, to NEG on battery.

If you don't have one and improvise, then a #6 won't fit in the load lug on the Allen Bradley mini distribution block. It does fit fine on the circuit breaker panel lug. The "load side" is only good for #10 or smaller on the distribution block. So that's the reason for more "home runs" to handle the load back to the Allen Bradley mini Distribution block. I didn't try it, but maybe TWO #6 could have fit on the LINE side of the Allen Bradley Mini distribution block, that certainly would have be worth a try.

But I see what you mean by going direct to the circuit breaker panel lug from the NEG of the battery. I was looking at the convenience because both leads of the battery connector would reach our 120 AMP breaker and the Allen Bradley Mini distribution block rather than trying to splice the NEG lead to reach the lug on the circuit breaker panel. Shorter = better with NO SPLICERS...

It's one of those, you gotta do what you gotta do things, but I certainly think it's safe and functions just as well and more importantly will handle all the load requirements with (3) #10s carrying the load.

I hope to see your Q/A, please do share it with everyone in this thread. I would need to know if FIRST is going to put their foot down and run to the hardware store to purchase a homemade 1/4-20 ground lug...[/quote]

Seems we are still looking, anyone not using theirs want to trade?

Thanks
Team 548
After much thinking, I've changed my position on this about 20 times. Litterally. If there is one thing I'm positive about, it's that I'm scared. I'm frightened. This is the first time in FIRST this has happened. I'm worried. A judgeing by FIRST can either be the beginning of something new, or the failure of FIRST. It can go either way.

Once I think more about it, I still don't like the so called 'colaboration', but I find out what ticks me off the most about it. It's not the teams building the robot together, but what this could do to future seasons, along with the fact they didn't even see if it was ok with FIRST. There's a difference, biased, yes, but still well founded, that it's dangerous for big businesses or teams join, it leads to big problems. I remeber a small Mac based software company, that started with nothing, but then grew very big. Yeah, it's Microsoft. They partnered with many big companies to screw over the little guy. While 254 and 60 might not be doing the last sentence, if this passes as ok, we might see this in future seasons. No longer could alliances be based on whos the best, but who you picked before the season to be a complement to your robot, which could even go to have a big influence of coroporations. Wouldn't it be a *really* good PR move to have all the Corporation X teams on one alliance!*

If you really wanted a challange, why didn't you give lots of your resources to rookie teams, and then build your robot whith just minimal money, tools, and time?

Overall, I hope we see something from FIRST about this, although I doubt the Update #10 thing-ie was relased because of this.

*sarcasm
you modeled all those in six weeks?if yes, you did a pretty good job in modeling. Try to use more realistic lights in your scene, it will take more time, but it worth. ;)
I commend Teams 60 and 254 for their work and for stepping outside the norm. I like that in a team and think it pushes the envelope. That is how we can drive change. Undoubtedly, Team 60 and 254 have learned a great deal about working together with diversity. Great value in that.

Sharing Intellectual Property (drawings, ideas, white papers, comments, critiques, strategy, etc.) improves the game for everyone as it continues to raise the level of play and challenges all teams to kick it up a notch to compete. That type of sharing and helping of other teams -to me, that is FIRST.

Helping at a competition, making a replacement part, showing someone how to program, offering advise and working on someone else's machine so that they can stay in the game - to me, that is FIRST.

I only disagree with the fact that 60 & 254 then made systems for each other. That did give an advantage because it is easier and quicker to make 2 of something than 1 of two different things. There are also the cost questions to be addressed. Sharing a machined part is different than sharing an idea or a drawing.

And so, 60 & 254 - good job at working together, good job at pushing the envelope, great bravery for making it all public knowledge.

Time will tell if you have created a Mustang or an Edsel.
Don't you know the sentence was for 20 years, no chance of parole?
Does anyone else think that this thread has run it's course, or is it just me?
EMP or vacuum.

We're still undecided, but we're leaning towards the vacuum.
Really? Where? :confused:
Either we will make a gross dozen KK donuts, we will use the topsy turvy gun from Armed and Dangerous, or we will use our computing power of our controller to do SETI@home.
Enough!

I first met Team 254 in a hanger at Moffet Field many years ago.  I met Team 60 that same year at Nationals.  Over the years I have enjoyed working with and playing against both teams.

I look forward to seeing if their idea works or not.

PS Both of you had better watch out.  We have a pretty good robot sitting out here in the desert.
Autonomous? What's autonomous? Awwww, I guess our robot is just gonna spin around in a circle firing rockets into the crowd killing innocent people. Sigh, back to the drawing board.
Was this in the court of Judge Judy?
Here they are in all their glory.  These gearboxes were inspired by a lot of great teams in the past.  They're definitely the most complex ones I've worked on in my seven years of involvment with FIRST.

Let us know what you think.
Unfortunately I haven't had very many interesting teachers. In fact the quote that I'm about to give came from a teacher-in-training. We were in US history class and we were doing one of our Debate Fridays. I couldn't believe she actually said this. She said, and I quote: "By the end of today I want everybody in here to be Master Debators." (sound it out) ;)
very nice job. I do have one comment though.. Isn't that the library used in the 3dsm advandced lighting tutorial?
Can Judge Judy give such a severe sentance?
did you modify the fisher price motor's gear box at all? That looks like 2 inch PVC for the roller. We tried out the same thing, but the motor ran way to slow to pick up anything quickly.
Thanks for the nice comment. We look forward to seeing you and your team at the upcoming regionals and International. Good luck this year. :p
hey. what kind of neon did you use? auto or computer? and how did you wire it to a  power supply? is there a batter in your box? if not, how did you get power to it.
plexi glass is heavy!! not only that, but in the competetion (guessing you've never been to one) there is ALOT of pushing a shoving and ramming into each other. If there was no support behind the plexi (like studs in a wall) it would most likely break. I dont know about you, but i wouldnt want to have to fix plexi in the pits. If you are really looking for an easy way out, try getting some reliable wood, or just using the frame they give.

I know i have lots of respect for the teams. 254 was paired w/ us at nationals in 2002 when i was on 151. and team 60 is awesome in my book. although someone mentioned, why team up with another "veteran" team, instead of helping out an underfunded team? heck you could've gotten chairmans if you both did that.

I just think that FIRST should step in and make a judgement about it, and clear up some tattered edges. just put in perspective all of the BAE SYSTEMS teams up here in the northeast, you would have 8 teams exactly the same. and then if that happened other teams would have a hissy fit about it. so dont bash me for what i believe in, but when i first read it, i was like...um ok, so now we have 2 identical robots...when did this become fair.


Thanks for the nice comment. We look forward to seeing you and your team at the upcoming regionals and International. Good luck this year. :p




OH PLEASE COME BACK TO VCU GIL!!!! PLLLEEEEAAASSSEEE!!!! I love your robot! Everyone on the team when I showed it to them went, 'Oh crap.' You guys made VCU the past few years! We need MOE, you guys, and we would have the best 300 alliance since last year!

BTW, Leo wasn't in today, so I couldn't say hi to him for you. :)

I enjoy reading these types of post more than any others.  These encouraging post themselves are inspirational to me who is an engineer.  It is further evidence to me that FIRST really does payoff and the hard work we all do has so much positive influence on so many.

Andy,

Just to clarify, by first seeding tiebreaker do you mean the first criteria used to break a tie if the primary criteria is tied OR the primary criteria itself?

E.g. This year, the primary criteria is Won-Loss record, with the first tiebreaker being accumulated losers score.


so anyway, my team gets this great idea to make our robot's frame completely out of plexiglass. With only little metal brackets. I do not think this will work. We are an am. team, and we have nothing done. We have a few small pieces of plexiglass and a few metal brackets. we have no wiring done, no drivetrain. A flawed design that basically will only move. Sooo.....my question is.....Can we basically bend over and kiss our chances of even getting this done goodbye? Any help would be appreciated! thanks

Mathew Smith

This is not supposed to be mean, but, you have NO chance of surviving a match with plexiglass. It will crack and break and splinter into a million pieces when another robot just barely nudges it... Our team learned this the first match in 2001 @ NYC. Hence why we have lots of lexan on reserve now. Attached is a pic of the shattering (the other robot barely nudged us on the side)...<br><br>![practicerun.jpg|600x291](upload://3NjoF8mUyAHf2Vjr5L8KtF8ePE.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![practicerun.jpg|600x291](upload://3NjoF8mUyAHf2Vjr5L8KtF8ePE.jpeg.jpeg)<br>


Andy,

Just to clarify, by first seeding tiebreaker do you mean the first criteria used to break a tie if the primary criteria is tied OR the primary criteria itself?

E.g. This year, the primary criteria is Won-Loss record, with the first tiebreaker being accumulated losers score.




What I meant was the first tiebreaker AFTER win loss record, which was the primary criteria.  I will give everyone who answered a chance to fix your answer if you feel the need.
first off, its clear to me that these two teams dont think they have broken the rules, or done anything wrong, or they would never have gone down this path. they have put several months (apparently) into this collaboration idea, coming up with the idea before the kickoff meeting, when there was no Q&A forum to ask - the danger there is the longer you go nurturing your idea without getting an official judgement, the more you convince yourself that there is nothing wrong with it

and I suspect by the time of the kickoff they had already convinced themselves what they were doing was ok, so they did not trouble FIRST with the question.

Nobody here is accusing these two teams of deliberately setting out to cheat or bend the rules - you can believe what you are doing is good and right, but still be wrong. I think that is the case here.


> Putting all other issues aside, I think KenW is just trying to address the issue of the letter of the rule, and that is, the robot can only use parts build by your own team, and parts that isn't built by your own team is limited by the $3500 rule. So, it is OK if you use parts not build by your own team, as long as they are within the $3500 limit. Otherwise it is against the rules.



this is NOT the problem I see with the rules - this is not a issue of who machined the parts or how much they cost.

The issue is that the rule I quoted several pages back clearly states that teams must fabricate and assemble ALL of their custom parts and assemblys after the kickoff meeting

Clearly each team must fabricate their OWN robot. Clearly you cant hire a professional design consulting team to come in and design and fabricate your subassemblies for you, then only bill you for the machining costs.

One team here designed and fabricated the drive trains, the other designed and fabricated the arm, and they bartered (traded) one for the other. That is a form of payment - not only for the machine shop time, but for the custom design of a subsystem intended specifically to play this years game.

The extreem extention of this, if it is allowed to stand: you will end up with small teams who have no resources signing up for 'design and fabricate' alliances in which several other teams design one subsystem each, then build 10 or 20 of them, and the smaller teams end up doing nothing but making buttons or tee shirts for the other 20 teams they allied with, or checking every teams kit of parts for missing components, or whatever trivial task they feel they can do because they have no engineers, money, machine shop or resources.

FIRST is hard. FIRST is suppose to be hard. If you dont have the mentors or resources to build a full custom robot then you have to make design tradeoff decisions and use some of the stuff FIRST gave you, the default transmissions, the default code, the default wheels....   That is a part of engineering - that is what has made this program so successful: it IS hard - it IS challenging - its the most difficult 6 weeks most students have ever experienced in their lives - and thats why they come back next year - they have been challenged to their maximum capacity and they LIKE what they found in themselves.

One last thing - I keep hearing people say how generous with their previous designs they are - everything is posted in white papers and they share all their designs. That is excellent, its great to raise the bar and then make your work public domain.

But please stop and consider that there are a lot of us out here who do not copy everything you do, who are not following in your wake saying thankyouthankyouthankyou we could not do this without you.

Some of us LIKE to brainstorm our own ideas, to come up with our own designs, to look at each year as a new challenge, and to put the students right smack in front of it. Sure we look at what other teams have posted in white papers and such, but if you could build your whole machine from other teams previous designs, then what is the point. Personally I dont think FIRST is intended to be program to train and inspire future machinist and welders.

The design is the thing.

I hope 60 and 254 can take a step back and see this, and understand why others are not only upset, but genuinely offended.
I have no clue!!!!
The easiest way to lock the trans into low is to pop of the black part that goes over the motor rotate it 90 degrees then put it back on :)

P.S.  Found that out last year by accident at the buckeye regional.  LOOOOOOOOOONG STORY :D
I don't think all this obsfucation is too good for actual robot code (in good fun, perhaps, but not for production code).  I try to keep my creativity confined to the blissful realm of comments (non-compiled) -- err.. mostly, anyway.  If something goes wrong (when doesn't it), staring at watermelons and other fruit all day might not help too much in troubleshooting ... variable names should be descriptive -- e.g., our drive motors last year had the variable name '[lr]chalupa' (for the harder to spell chipahuah ... well, yeah, hence the easier to spell consistently variable name).

With my comments, if you understand why they are there, it is a sure sign you understand the code (well, almost).  I was thinking about writing the code in iambic pentameter (or at least composed of iambs more likely) -- but having to end most lines with semi-colon, or the frequent open parentheses, close square bracket, tilde carret, combinations made it difficult.  Plus, my comments were added so that non-programming types can enjoy the code and perhaps understand it -- something obsfucation tends to decrease the odds of.

But it does make one ponder.  What if shakespeare were a programmer?  (Much apologies to my english teacher; I can only imagine how her face must be writhing now, considering such heresy as this.)

(Oh, and to the humour impaired, strict style programmer out there, my tongue is thoroughly lodged in my cheek as I write this.)

OK, I'm taking the opposing view (how stupid can I be to oppose Andy Baker) - I value Andy's opinion more than my own but I need to chime in on this.

If it's a question of the tone or the manner the criticism is presented, I agree - need to be careful in word selection.  Unfortunately one of the limits of written critique is you can't tell what's a positive comment and what's negative since there's no voice inflection or facial expression.

However - I have been a design engineer for over twenty years and lead engineer for the past several.  There is one point I hammer home to young engineers when we go into our design reviews both at work and on the team - don't become emotionally attached to your design.  The intent of a design review is to improve the design, not to tell you what a great job you did.  Sometimes that's a tweak; sometimes it means start over.

You should look at this as an opportunity to defend your design in a positive manner (without getting defensive), but don't be afraid or embarrassed to say you don't know or you didn't consider something.  Here's some ways to respond:

"it looks good, but does it work?"

We built a prototype and it moved (pulled, turned, etc.) better than we expected.
It was a little slow but we changed the bearings and it's running very well now.

"that part looks too heavy, you need to lose weight"

My budget for this part was 6.5 pounds and I'm under that.
We needed this part to be robust because it's right in the front.

"that ratio looks way off. you should try... (yada yada)"

I checked my calculations again and we're operating well down on the power curve.
I checked my calculations again and it was a little high but the next size wouldn't fit in the envelope.

At the end of the process I frequently have changed the entire design because I liked someone elses ideas, and just as frequently I have considered all the critique and decided I was correct and pressed on.  Either way, when you get to competition and something works well you can be proud of it.
Chris,
In the past we just stacked two eyelet terminals on the same stud to distribute either supply or return leads.  We of course insulate with heatshrink the terminals that are used for either.

Dez,
I have to go along with Chris on the distro block, it is designed for three phase power distro and probably (I can't remember what the label speced) can handle 600 volts block to block without arcing over.  I actually like this block for distro and I think many teams will find it very easy to use.  It has two failings though, the #6 doesn't fill up the input side (That is why I fold over a 3/8" of the #6 to fully fill the void.) and a less than prudent electrical person will force the #10 into a hole without fully retracting the locking screw.  This will invariably result in a few strands sticking out to get into trouble with it's neighbors.  Other than the weight, I would like to use this in the future.
:ahh:  that is the prettiest robot out there but i thought it was a teaser... the anidization looks great :yikes:
I modeled the car before comps....and some other models 2 , yes the building is off of a tutorial but w/ some mods.... i think anything in tuts is fair game correct?

I'll throw this link in here so this thread doesn't turn out to be bad.

**[Critical and picky - here I go again](http://http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=25464)**

Even though i've not had much experience using Plexi-glass in robot operations, I've played with it enough to know that it will shatter and crack fairly easily.  I also seem to remember a lot of threads in the past asking this exact same question, "Should we use plexi-glass or lexan" and the majority of the time most responses went, "Use lexan" for one reason or another.

Also, one thing i saw was people confusing the terms lexan(polycarbonate) and plexi-glass(acrylic).  I just don't want this thread to turn into a "Let's argue about what its called thread".

This is not the end of the world for your robot. With the right support I think it will be just fine, but that's just my opinion.
Please, please listen to me very carefully!  The planetary CVT will NOT produce more output torque as you describe it!!  I know from experience that this is not true.  When I first did the equations like you describe I made the exact same error.  I made an assumption (actually, a few) that were flawed.  The mistake is easy to make and I made it too.  When we first got our prototype running, the mistake was obvious.

With two drivers (motors) on a planetary gearbox it is relatively easy to manipulate the SPEED ratio of the input to output.  It is true that if you spin the ring gear motor in the opposite direction of the sun gear motor you can get the output shaft to not rotate at all while providing a great amount of torque.  However, that torque is the same no matter how fast you spin the ring gear and no matter what direction!!  It is the same even if the ring gear motor is not there!!  The ring gear motor is taking the place of the housing.  When you put the ring gear on a bearing you need to have the motor provide the reaction force that the housing used to provide.  The planetary gearset is a lever: the sun gear to planet to ring gear interaction is independant of speed when we are dealing with torque.

The advantage of the configuration is that you will be getting the same output torque at each speed ratio.  So even at the faster speeds, you will get the same output torque as at the low speed.  Other shifters sacrifice torque for speed, the planetary psuedo-CVT does not.

I have derived the governing equations in my 2002 Whitepaper located here:

[ThunderChickens CCT](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=79)

I will just be blunt: The way you think your CVT will work is dead wrong!  I do not want to be rude, but my team wasted a lot of time, money, and energy because I made the same bad assumptions you are making.  I do not want to see another team go through what we did.  All is not lost. Once we understood how the system actually worked, we sized our drives accordingly and the CCT worked beautifully.

BTW, the worm gear had nothing to do with any of it.  It was our way of making a small package for the ring gear drive.

Plexiglass is a tough thing to use for robot body.  It does shatter and easily cracks when you drill into it.  Lexan works better and is less prone to damage but weighs a ton, heavier than aluminum.  No you are not out of the competition at this point.  Just think about a little modification.  Use some aluminum extrusion to frame out the same dimensions you already have and start bolting it together.  Move things bit by bit over to the new frame and voila! a robot is born.  If you can't get it done before ship, cut as much as you can now and ship all the parts in the container with the robot.  You will have lot's of work at your first regional but you can get it done.  Ask for help from other teams, they are required to help if they can.  I know that one team at Great Lakes last year, came with a box of parts and built their robot at the regional.  "Never give up, never surrender!!"
okay thanks for the info.....
i just hope we can get it tested soon and see how good (or bad) it is (like backdriving etc....)


This is not supposed to be mean, but, you have NO chance of surviving a match with plexiglass. It will crack and break and splinter into a million pieces when another robot just barely nudges it...

Good advice.  One of the things that many people get confused with is the difference between acrylic and polycarbonate.  Plexiglas is the best-known trade name for acrylic and Lexan* is the best-known trade names for polcarbonate.

Many people get these two materials confused.  I hope that Mathew is saying plexiglas while his team is really using polycarbonate.  Like Yan said, polycarbonate works well for many teams, but acrylic does not.

Mathew - are you sure it's plexiglas and not polycarbonate?

* btw, here is a related piece of trivia:  Lexan was the first polycarbonate invented.  Dan Fox mistakingly created it in 1963, as he was working at General Electric.  GE had the patent on it for 17 years before another company could make it.  Now there are other trade names, but Lexan is still the original.  (I spent 4 co-op terms working for GE Plastics, making Lexan and Ultem.)

Also... a side note:  the density of polycarbonate is 0.043 lb/in^3 while the density of aluminum is 0.098 lb/in^3.
Are you supposed to upload the forms? I thought you just mail them can someone give me some more info....like where to get the forms etc...
sorry for not really answering ur question just posting more...

> Mathew - are you sure it's plexiglas and not polycarbonate?

I'm sure if they broke any pieces drilling them it probably is polycarbonate.  Those materials are a pain in the but to use.

> Also, one thing i saw was people confusing the terms lexan(polycarbonate) and plexi-glass(acrylic). I just don't want this thread to turn into a "Let's argue about what its called thread".

Actually they are trade-names which is why it gets so confusing.  The trade names for polycarbonate are: Lexan, Hyzod, and Tuffak.  The trade names for acrylic well according to my book there is only one trade name.  It is plexi-glass.  Go figure.  Also I have heard bad stories about using loctite on plastic materials.  I heard it actually weakens the materials.  Anyone care to find out if this is true?
*hint* Want to see something cool.  Take two polarizing filters and stack them one on top of the other.  Turn them until you can't see any light coming out.  Then point them at a opaque material like lexan.  You would be able to see any of the stresses put on the material*end of hint*
thsi late in the season I recommed you use 3/8" plywood for the base and the 2x4 alum pieces that FIRST gave your for the sides.

we built a pratice robot like this in november with parts left over from last year. It only took us 3 one hour meetings, at the highschool, to put it together and get it running

Im certain you could do the same in one weekend.
Who going to stop her?

> "it looks good, but does it work?"

Those were the same questions we were talking about our robot and yet you didn't even see it yet.:) Anyway I usually ask the first question when I don't know how something works.  Im not trying to be critical.  Then I usually ask design questions just to see why those choose to go one way or another.
That thing is a work of art.  It is simply stunning.  Is that annodized aluminum?  Also, is the roller chain chromed? Wow some much detail.
Just play around in it. See how long you can go without having to reboot and enter Windows. If you aren't sure how to do something, try to find out how on the web, even though it might have been faster just to reboot to windows, where you know how to do it. Basically, just force youself to use it and one day you'll suddenly realize you don't need Windows. On that day, rasie a flag and declare your independence from the tyranny. ;)
I see there being criticism and constructive criticism.  Most comments I have seen are criticism, as they do not give very much thought or reason into a questin they are asking about a picture/robot.

It seems like everytime a robot picture or teaser gets up loaded it is the same 2 or 3 people asking questions about it too.  If you wanna know information I see that PM'ing the uploader of the picture to be the best option that way you do not clog the portal page with threads says "Ohhh I like" or "Yeah, but i dont like..." etc etc etc.....

I totally agree with Andy on this matter and feel PM's should be used when responding to most images uploaded to this site.


Let us know what you think.



One word: Slick!

...I hope 60 and 254 can take a step back and see this, and understand why others are not only upset, but genuinely offended.






*stands up and agrees with Ken* Great Job Ken nice way in general to post about the whole situation, and not to offend anyone!
Ha, this sounds like so much fun, I would have done it but I am in the same boat as magnasmific. Anyway one kid on my team has done this without knowing of such a thing so there wont be a fefore pic is that still okay?
Are you guys going to submit that thing to the Smithsonian or the Met? That thing would be marveled by all engineer or not!!!!  :ahh:
Kudos to you guys the first ball collector of the year on CD. Anyways that is a nice robot. Just curious do you just line up with the ball corral and put it in reverse with the same mechanism that collected the balls? or is there some other output that I am not seeing
Curiousity may have killed the kat but satisfaction brought him back!

Looks like another successful robot for Team 190, and another succesful bar hanger. Good luck to you guys this year but try and cut out the monkey business :LOL:



[edit]
My amazing and considerate girlfriend, who puts up with so much crap during the FIRST season, and is very compromising when it comes to FIRST, (the ultimate time drain)... Anyone who thinks I should leave her because she likes me clean shaven (a small gesture I can make, for all the things she puts up with) needs to get their priorities re-examined... :(
[/edit]




See, he knows what he's talking about.  All of my ex's know my rule.  They can not shave as much as they want, but they better not expect me to get anywhere near that unshaven face!   :D

> Kudos to you guys the first ball collector of the year on CD. Anyways that is a nice robot. Just curious do you just line up with the ball corral and put it in reverse with the same mechanism that collected the balls? or is there some other output that I am not seeing

It would appear that the balls would be able to be backed out the way they came.  Nice job on your robot.

> did you modify the fisher price motor's gear box at all? That looks like 2 inch PVC for the roller. We tried out the same thing, but the motor ran way to slow to pick up anything quickly.

I know we ran a two to one gear ratio and our balls move slowly.  We might try making a replacement one after the robot is done.



"that ratio looks way off. you should try... (yada yada)"



I'll be open and say that I've tried to help out some teams in the past few weeks by showing some quick math to help adjust some gear ratios.

Last year was VERY painful for us because our gear ratios were so poor. We were tripping breakers left and right, and we couldn't figure out why. It was incredibly embarassing.

I wish somebody would have just pointed and said, "Hey Matt, that's geared wrong! Switch those sprockets to 25 tooth and you'll be all set. Here's the math to support it."

Figuring out the right gear ratio is something that's so important, I try to help teams avoid the heartache we had last year- by saying something before the competition starts. I believe for many teams, the $60 or $70 in sprockets they'll need to replace so they can compete at a reasonable level may be worth a little ego bruising. I try to show math that would help support other teams that may have the same trouble, so everyone can learn, and avoid this sort of engineering mistake.

Often, these teams are either student run, or engineer light, and I think it's in the best interest of everyone if somebody napkin-sketches out a gear ratio corss check when it sounds funny.

However, maybe it is best left to a PM. I'd just hate to see teams go without this sort of information.

Matt




Clearly each team must fabricate their OWN robot. Clearly you cant hire a professional design consulting team to come in and design and fabricate your subassemblies for you, then only bill you for the machining costs.

One team here designed and fabricated the drive trains, the other designed and fabricated the arm, and they bartered (traded) one for the other. That is a form of payment - not only for the machine shop time, but for the custom design of a subsystem intended specifically to play this years game.






i wanted to clear up something that seems to have lost (but was clearly stated in the beginning of this thread) each team had a hand in the design of every part of the robot...the drive train was not designed by 254, built to 254 and shipped to 60. we spent the time designing together, and then distributed the load of fabrication. so there was no..."hey i'll trade you my drive train for your arm"

and as for us fabricating our "own" robot...yea we did...we spent the time to design...and then split up the work load among our team members.

People have good points on this thread.  Gary and Matt's counter-points are excellent.

So... my plea to those of you who want to give advice or ask questions - follow the example that you see on these forums by having some tact and grace when you wonder if something works or if it is overweight.

It is tough to not put emotions into a design that you've worked hard on for the past 5 weeks.  While being non-emotional about a deisgn is the correct thing to do, it is extremely difficult.

Andy B.
I'm going to go on record as agreeing with Andy (well, there's a surprise).  However, I think the problem is generally bigger than simply criticism of other team's robots.  For those who've been on Chief Delphi for many years (now I feel old), the same sorts of activities have been going on for those years (I seem to remember quite a number of fights in 2001).

In my opinion, a lot of these hard feelings and fights are related to misunderstandings.  It's much more difficult to convey a message in text than it is spoken.  There's a lack of voice inflection; a lack of body language.  It's much more difficult to tell a joke in text than it is out loud.  This is doubly so when you're attempting to tease someone.

In another direction, it's important when giving criticism to give constructive criticism.  Criticism is useless unless there's somewhere to go with it.  It's not required that you have a solution for a problem but it is required that you phrase the criticism in such a way that the actual problem is targetted and not the person.

I think I have to disagree with Andy over the idea that all criticism should be sent through PM's.  I think we all can learn quite a bit from good criticism and there's something that we can all contribute to it.  The opportunity is lost if it's not constructive criticism.

Matt
Sorry to hear about your problems, but don't throw in the towel yet.  It's easy to get overwhelmed, especially in your rookie year, with trying to do too much and seeing alot of things fail.  You still have over a week left - see what you can do positively.  Ken's idea about plywood and kit parts is a good start - get something driving so you can get some practice.  A moving robot is an asset in any match - you can certainly block your opponent's corral and you can push balls even if one at a time.  Use the default code - go back to square one and take smaller steps.

BTW - when you get to the competition I think you'll be surprised at how supportive other teams are.  No-one will look down on you if your robot is dead, in fact they'll pitch in and try to help you get it started.  You will enjoy this event regardless of how you robot performs.

Our rookie robot was named "Kenny" because it got killed every match.  But we learned alot and moved on.

And don't use plexiglass/acrylic.  Use Lexan/polycarbonate.


talk about some kind of motivation huh? well actually this was more like the icing on a cake for a season spent. but this guy has always had crazy hair, so i mean the loss of the ponytail didnt affect him too much =)


Yeah, to compensate for his loss, he simply had the remnants spiked with yellow and black wax goop compliments of 48 and voila!  ....He looks so happy!

Some of the students, engineers (including myself), and the head teacher coach (who's well on his way to being bald anyway so he shouldn't count) have promised to get our heads shaved if we win a competition this year.<br><br>![Warren Hairdo.jpg|358x265](upload://hjZFu59qTbyPTKERsIZRs9S0YdE.jpeg.jpeg)<br><br><br>![Warren Hairdo.jpg|358x265](upload://hjZFu59qTbyPTKERsIZRs9S0YdE.jpeg.jpeg)<br>


Before CAD, drafting & design classes were held with drawing boards and students making designs on large pieces of paper.  There were pencils, eraser shields, and brushes to wipe your eraser bits off of the boards.

Students had to be fairly clean with their work, and had to tape down their paper to the table to keep things in order.

My high school drafting teacher was a fairly funny guy, and whenever the class would start a new drawing, he would always come up behind some unsuspecting student (in this case, me) who was just beginning to tape his paper down to the table and say...

"Baker, remember... it's sticky side down."



At our school we have to take a sememester of board drawing before we can go on to the full year of CAD so we can learn what it takes and why you dont want ot make mistakes but any way my favorite drafting qoute by far is my teacher walking up and down the aisles keep says "Remember men, BLACK is BEEEEEEEEEUITFUL"
it all depends on what you want to do..
1) What pwm output will it be on
2)Do you want it to include special functions (such as a trigger to make it go to a certain point)

These are easily modifiable in the given default code.. just goto user_routines.c in the workspace, then find where it shows the mappings of inputs (joysticks) to outputs (pwm outouts, controlling motors)
What do you want your arm to do?  How is it wired up?  Do you have any sensors doing anything?  I'll post some sample code later, but the chances that it will be right for your arm are slim...


if this collaboration is the greatest thing since sliced bread then why even have the robot COMPETITION at all?  shouldn't we all just get together and try to come up with one really great robot idea that is simply awesome?  wouldn't that just be the greatest?  no.  competition makes America what it is.  competition between teams, companies, democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives...without competition nothing ever really gets better.  without competition healthcare doesn't get faster and cheaper, cars don't get better gas mileage, and things progress much more slowly than before.  I hope...no, I PRAY...that Cyber Blue never, never, never NEVER goes to this idea.  Cooperation is one thing, so is helping a team at a competition, or mentoring them, or posting a white paper, or showing pictures, or this or that... but the bottom line is building two identicle robots is not the same as these things and therefore should not be compared to them...come on :(




i had an epiphany and i'd like to take a minute to appologize for some of the things i said in my post.  i won't delete that post because i don't believe that re-writing the past is the answer...i'll just add to it.  i was where i'm sure we all were last night...done with school, just got off work, tired, hungry and i had a headache.  this isn't an excuse (ok i guess it kind of is) i just want to explain myself.  anyways...here i go.

i appologize for my seeming priggishism (sorry, just learned that word and wanted to use it and saw golden opportunity).  this isn't black and white...at all.  i'm sorry i saw it that way.  there is a lot of grey.

i do think that helping other teams is good, very good, and i guess if i look at this from a different angle i can see the fact that you all are helping each other.  that's good.

you may ask if i agree with the fabrication...no...but the principles i do agree with.

i won't go into the "real world" because everyone's "real world" is different...i'll stick with my version of FIRST.  FIRST (this is all FIRST to me) is as David Kelly said all about the I.  without Inspiration this becomes a science fair (and we all know how Dean feels about that).  i've been inspired in different ways along my journey in FIRST.  without that "I" i wouldn't have a desk at Rolls-Royce and the opportunity of a lifetime as a high schooler.  for me...a lot of that Inspiration comes because of the competition.  for others...it must not.

a note to teams 60 and 254-i personally look forward to seeing you at competitions (60 in AZ) not because of the robot but because of the idea and how it could possibly pertain to the FIRST International Partners (FIPs) idea.  i think (with a little tweaking) it could work.  of course, we would need an official word from FIRST and we'd have to keep it legal...but i think there are possibilities.

as i said before...it's all about the I.  and as long as the kids on teams 60 and 254 were "I"'d...congratulations.

again...kingman...come see me in Phoenix...i'll be looking for you guys to get more details.

p.s.  thanks amanda. :)


1.) 1995

2.) Best record (wins and losses)

3.) Highest scoring ball in the goal




Andy,
In that case.  2.) Tiebreaker would be total points scored in seeding matches
It looks really nice to me.  You can definately tell that someone spent a lot of time working on it.  I do have high speed internet, so I really can't comment much on load time (though just in case you were wondering, it took seconds).  Great job, it looks really good.  :D

> i wanted to clear up something that seems to have lost (but was clearly stated in the beginning of this thread) each team had a hand in the design of every part of the robot...the drive train was not designed by 254, built to 254 and shipped to 60. we spent the time designing together, and then distributed the load of fabrication. so there was no..."hey i'll trade you my drive train for your arm"


I dont see any problem with two teams deciding to join forces, esp if they are short on resources and mentors this year, to form one team and build one robot, and compete as one team.

but I dont want to be on the opposite side of the field against a robot that was designed by two teams (or more) against the bot we designed on our own. and I certainly dont want to be on the field opposite TWO robots in the elimination rounds that were designed together to BE a multi-team effort.

Surely you can see that pitting two againts one is not good sportsmanship - go back and read what Dennis posted on the 1st page of this thread - he said you guys decided you could build a better product working together than either team could by themselves

yes, exactly! which is not fair to the teams that build their bots by themselves. try to see this from the viewpoint of other teams, smaller teams, rookie teams who are going to end up getting trampled by your machines.

if you did not have the resources to create a drivetrain and an acquistion system this year, you could have used the default drivetrain that FIRST provided, like MANY other teams are doing this year - and if you did not have the resources to design a super acquision system this year you could have designed a simple ball pushing device like MANY other teams will be using this year.


1020 is student run and it was very difficult.  Aim to sustain a team and have fun while learning and growing and getting more people into FIRST.  It couldn't hurt to get some sleep, too!




Brandon's completely right... our team is largely based on peer mentoring.  While last year's frustrations turned into a dark cloud over our heads, the kids worked through the rain.

Sometimes, a bad start, a disappointing season, or even a comment from a peer can really get you down in the dumps.  I think the majority in this thread know that it's possible, but there are a lot of ways to bring yourself back up.  Counseling, sitting down with a mentor, or even just going out with a group of students after a meeting keep things in light spirits.

Last year, 1020 went to a local coffee shop after weekend meetings.  It really did help to relieve stress (and most of the time I ended up laughing until I was so tired I didn't want to move).  This year, the students still go out occasionally, and it seems as though this informal time together really helps combat any negative feelings.

Things'll get better - competition is right around the corner!  :)
what did they put controls on before 1995?
Hi, the site looks great.  I think the grey looks a little bland as your background, it'd look better white.  I think you shouldn't use Java for your picture galleries simply because it doesn't always work for everyone.  If I had Norton Internet Security on it wouldn't have worked.

and as for us fabricating our "own" robot...yea we did...we spent the time to design...and then split up the work load among our team members. ~ej




no it is not your "own" robot, it is yours **and** Kingman's robot....the fact that you have 2 or 4 makes no difference....you said it yourself you both had a hand in designing these robots....there are some serious double standards going on here.....

you have your own robot, but you didn't design it just yourselves.....you split the design and the workload up between two teams, by my calculations this makes this robot 1/2 yours

you all make minor adjustments and then claim they are different robots, but if one wins a design award the other team gets to feel as if they are a part of it.....

i don't want to seem mean or cruel, but from my viewpoint there are a lot of differing opinions **within** the teams....colleges, companies, and other organization work together to find things out (just like you did with the drive train over the summer) but you won't see two companies with the same knowledge and experience bring two identical products to market....sry just the way i feel....


FIRST is hard. FIRST is suppose to be hard. If you dont have the mentors or resources to build a full custom robot then you have to make design tradeoff decisions and use some of the stuff FIRST gave you, the default transmissions, the default code, the default wheels....   That is a part of engineering - that is what has made this program so successful: it IS hard - it IS challenging - its the most difficult 6 weeks most students have ever experienced in their lives - and thats why they come back next year - they have been challenged to their maximum capacity and they LIKE what they found in themselves.




I don't want to delve into the legality of the issue because that is under FIRST's jurisdiction. It makes me extremely curious as to what's being discussed right now.

However, I do want to agree with what Ken said above... FIRST is hard and one of the things I enjoy and get out of the program is a sense of pride from being unique. Last year, I was especially proud that my team decided to take on the task of stacking/protecting bins, an area of the game which was underrepresented. I won't give my opinion about collaboration, but I will say that I can't imagine having the identical robot as another team. That would ruin a lot of the fun for me. Being unique is awesome - that's why individual teams get rewarded through design and innovation awards.


I posted our forms for the Autodesk Award for Visualization about 3 days ago, but now it's not there... now , I'm wondering, was this Autodesk taking them off there to make room, or has someone possibly removed them? We still have our folder to upload our finished animation to, so I'm assuming it's ok... maybe I'm just paranoid, I don't know.  If need be, I could always re-upload them.  :confused:




To be safe I would eMail them and see what happened.  They could've deleted to make more room (since the site ran out of space!) or someone could've deleted them (not sure if you could do that, but you could view other peoples forms).  I didn't understand why they enabled other teams to view the information in those documents.



Are you supposed to upload the forms? I thought you just mail them can someone give me some more info....like where to get the forms etc...




I think mailing the forms was another option, you didn't have to post it on Streamline.  The forms in Word format are posted on Streamline under 2004 FIRST Competition and under the folders Inventor Award Criteria & Visualization Award Criteria.
if you go with lexan instead of plexiglass ask for polycarbonate - same stuff much cheaper.....gl
Something else to remember - at the competition there is some time for last minute adjustments.  There is also a ton of mentors, engineers, and help from other teams that are always very happy to help a team in need.

Next year spend some time to round up a few more adults.  Even just a team mom helps a ton.  Best of luck!!!
Do they all come out when put in reverse?  We found that the balls will get jammed with only two rollers.
Its not clear what parts and controller you have?

the EDU bot from last year only runs Pbasic, not C (and by last year, I mean the 2003 competition year - the EDU robot controllers for this year were actually shipped out in the fall of 2003, but they are considered to be 2004 units)

Have you found the documentation at www.innovationfirst.com ? the documents for the older EDU bots is all there in the 'previous' archive section.

if you have the full size robot controller from a previous year, then you will want to take a look at the archived manual from that year at www.usfirst.org - they have all the wiring diagrams  in the robot section of the manual - bwteeen those two websites you should be able to find all the instructions and drawings and schematics you need to expeiment with what you have.

Good luck towards next year - hope to see you at a regional.

and please feel welcome to continue this discussion with any questions you have - I dont mean to dismiss your questions by pointing you towards websites - most of what you need to know is already there.
I just viewed the site and ours is not in the list either! What's going on? I'll probably email them tonight once I get home.
I'd take either the high-end laptop or desktop from L.

the only thing the arm does that excludes the grippers is move 270 degrees. And we are using the van door motor!


4)  An engineer on my other team (226, I'm a mentor/alumni), one of the engineers someone said something about being able to connect the two RC's (The Edu and the FIRST one) so that our programmer can still use C (What he's been learning) but we can use the operator interface from the FIRST one.  Can anybody explain this furthur?



If you have a 2004 Edu RC (which runs C) you can interface it to an old PBASIC Edu RC or old FIRST RC in order to be able to use the old OI and controls to control the new 2004 Edu RC.  I wrote some software & documentation for this and it's available [here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=245).  If you try to set this up and have problems please let me know and I'll do what I can to help.

Best of luck to you getting a team together for 2005!

Foxtrot or Calvin & Hobbes?
WEll i am just going to keep my thoughts to myself i would just like to say a few things

i agree with ken he has hit the points that i think

One thing i would liek everyone to look at
We see this going on and i mean shure they built the same robot and it does mostly the same thing. But next year i mean what if teams join uop see the task and make two robots cover all the aspects of the game
example
Say next year my team 710 and like 108 team up to make two different  robots that work together. we both go to the same regionals., maybe we wont be paired together in qualfication matches but what stops us from picking each other in elminations so if we seeded like 1st or 2nd we could pick 108 and wouldnt we be unstoppable cause our robots were made to work together.

I thought it was great that they worked on designs together but i think they crossed the line makin each others parts. IF my team only had to think about one thing (arm or drivetrain) would it make it alot easier. I mean that is like using only half your brain

Both these teams are looked up to in the FIRST community and i still look up to them i just wish they would of thought a little more about there descion to work together and how it would effect the rest of us
We had enough money to pay our down payment for the EDU, so we have the 2004 EDU kit, but an old full size RC, or will have an old full size RC.

I guess a better question would have been, After the battery and the controller, what is the bare minimum of other electrical stuff.  We're running on a 300 budget, hence the reason most of the other stuff was donated.

Hmmm.  It was rather depressing when we first found out that we couldn't officialy compete, but I've come to realize a practice year is definiely a good thing.  I'm almost glad we weren't stuck trying to figure all of this out in six weeks.

Allison
then you are going to want to control the motor using a Victor, and thus a PWM. set the variable pwmXX (XX being the number of the output the victor is connected to) to a number from 0 to 255 - 0 is full reverse, 255 is full forward, and 127 is neutral (stopped).

Why such large sprockets?  Also, what size and wall thickess is your frame material?




Thats a very good question.  I hope we are planning on downsizing them, but the problem might be that we can't get smaller ones on island.  For the second question, its 1"-1", 1/8" wall aluminium (welded together).



The robot looks good. The spiral wrap you added was a good addition, really neatens it up. I just want to point out that you might want to add chain tensioners. The one on the left appears to have a bit of slack.




Thanks, I liked the spiral wrap too, its a lot better than the last two years where a cable actually got severed in the chains.  And the tensioners was another thing I was hoping to doing.  I had a plan for this and was wondering if it would be a good idea.  I was thinking about putting a piece of HDPE between the chains, so the chains cut it until the rollers touch, keeping it from being cut any more.  Once the rollers touch, the chain should slip on the HDPE, but still be tight from the pressure upwards.  So if you or anyone else could tell me if this is a good or bad idea, that would be great.

Thanks again,
Bobby
There is only one plastic strong and tough enough.  LEXAN.
All, that is All of the other and cheaper choi :) ces will crack and let you down. I can tell you this after 4 years of experience.
If you're using any of the full-sized motors, you will need some Victor 884 Speed Controller modules (883s will probably do for now) and/or some SPIKE Relay Modules.
Just so ya'll know this I drew up in Rhino 3d in a couple hours, its not a rendering from our animation.
Oooh cool!  Have you hooked them up yet?  It'd be interesting to know how well they run.  These look custom made; was it difficult?
any chance of using lexa or plexiglass for a base is nto good. I am guess you are a rookie team. We use lexan to protect the compenents of our robot and for skins. Lexan is strong but not made to be a base. I would not quit yet but i would suggest go get some wood like mentioned about and just build it out of wood. Especially with a game that i think is gonna involve alot of contact between robots like last year youa re gonna need somethign that holds up


what did they put controls on before 1995?




Before the platforms were used, controls were just held by the drivers and operators in hand as they stood on the side of the field.
the header/title image at the top of the page does not need to be a rollover, and contributes very little while increasing page load time. I'd recommend just making it static.
If you want it to move exactly 270 degrees, you will need some sort of feedback system.  I would recommend a pot - do you know how to wire one up?
After some testing in gcc, I figured it out.  The more descriptive errors helped.  The page I was reading was incorrect about the ordering of the type name versus the variable name.  I'm actually passing a bitmask value that I #defined as a bitmask, but I just did it this way so it's easier for people to understand the pointer stuff that's going on.  It's so nice having full ansi C.

We have two 3/8" drill motors, two Van Door motors from ?2001? I think, and two other motors that I'm not sure what they are.  They are about 2 in long and have a square shaft covered in plastic that lies perpendicular to the motor.  I'll take a picture at meeting tonight and post it.
Then you will need some speed controllers for the drill motors and the van door motors, and spikes for the window motor.

Honestly, I believe that at the end of it all, no one will give this topic a second look if team 254 and 60 aren't very successful this year. If they do manage to do very well, then everyone will be on them saying they were able to do so well because of an "unfair advantage they created by working in tandem with another team." If they manage to do well as an alliance, then everyone will be extremely bitter and take things to the FIRST level. There, thats a sweeping generalization for you, success driven prosecution. Not only does the aforesaid highlight why we really care about the collaboration of these teams, but it also highlights a problem I have noticed in alot of places, including FIRST: everyone has a knack for acting in their best interest, but not for acting with the intent of finding the most suitable compromise. I have to wonder, though, if everyone uses gracious professionalism and what is in the "Spirit of FIRST" as a crutch for their arguments, then do they not see that they are defeating themselves? I mean, there is nothing wrong with disagreeing with the partnerships between 60 and 254 (I still have mixed feelings), but don't do so in a way that makes you look narrow-minded, because then yelling begins, and then all things after are unusable.

I've have seen discussions in the past that attempted to girdle a "controversial" topic, but failed miserably. After such failure, some well-known poster would submit a lengthy post stating why we should interact better as a community, and how we should allow discussions to grow. Many of the participants in the discussion would apologize to each other and the thread would be closed. One would think after such episodes that no more will happen, but thats often far from the truth. A few weeks later another controversy, or conflict of interest would arise and the cycle would repeat itself.

This thread has an interesting topic, one that should be discussed to a great extent. I would hate to see the mods have to close it because they start having flashbacks to other threads that ended with individuals having changed opinions about each other, and with teams hating each other. This thread is not there yet, so lets keep it that way.

I'd take this post as a quick and dirty history lesson on chiefdelphi discussions gone bad. The moral: think privately, then share openly your refined opinion. Readers should see the best of what you have to say, not just the first thing that comes to your mind.
Didn't plexiglass(acrylic) used to be illegal on FIRST robots since it is so brittle?  I know some acrylic got mixed in with our excess stock of polycarbonate, found out the hard way when it shattered while trying to be bent.  Eitherway, polycarbonate frames have been done before.  In 2001 we had a [robot with no structural metal](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=337&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose)
Browsing the gallery, it looks like team 49 also did a [robot made primarily out of lexan](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=386&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose)

So yes its possible, given your time crunch though, wood might be easier to get and to work with.  Just get a drive train that runs first and go from there, there's still plenty of time left.  Good luck,
~Scott

I agree totally wiht you thats what i did cause if i posted right when they said  they were workign together i would had bad reputation. Please everyone think about what youpost before you post cause i would liek this thread to stay open to see were this goes

My thoughts up above our toned way down from what iw as thinking intitally
I agree, if you absolutely must use a plastic, use lexan. It is more durable, and while it does splinter and shatter, it is less likely to do besides plexiglass. If you use this, you have to support it, using plexiglass or lexan will no support is a sure way to have a base be totally demolished. Supporting the base with aluminum extursion at stress points (if you can, ask an engineer to evaluate your design and offer advice on where to support it) is a very good idea.

Now Ken is also right. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using plywood as a base. In fact, one team that comes to mind that uses a wood base every year and is one of the well known teams in FIRST is Team 173 Rage. Every year they use a wood frame (which I'm not mistaken is supported by aluminum brackets). It may splinter, but with the brackets, it's an easy fix. Just put a sheet of aluminum or steel over it, bolt it on, and you're ready to go. I bring up Rage, because they are one of the well known teams that uses a wood base, and have so for years.

And yes, if you turn up at your regional with your robot unfinished, it's guarenteed other teams will come over to help you. No team is going to look down upon you, in fact most teams will do everything in their power to make sure your robot works and is able to compete. That's the great thing about FIRST, everyone is willing to help each other to make sure the competition is as good as it can be and everyone has a fighting chance.
The 3" PVC is hooked directly to the Fisher Price Motor.  There is a ramp behind it gives the balls support as they go up.  It is a bit slower than we would like but seems to work just fine.

To get the balls out the motor is reversed and they all come out.  We have had very few problems jamming balls because the opening is just wide enough for two balls to go through.  More testing will be conducted though.

Thanks for all the encouragement!
You MUST use the ground stud as a gatherer for all the incoming grounds. In the set up you have now, this is not possible.
our biggest mistake was when we first made the pole to hang on. the sponsor lights hang about 10 feet from teh ground so placin the platform in the upright position it knocked down the whole florscent light fixture breaking both bulbs on us now that hurt


Looking at the pneumatics guide the picture they have of the double solenoid (the t looking one) shows the wires connected to the side. On ours there's just the pins and no connector.

I looked around our shop for like 2 hours and couldn't find anything. Do we have to make our own or can we buy them and get them really really soon?





where are you located? i might be able to mail your our extra from last year.

they defently came in the kit though, they are very small so keep one of the new guys looking.
I think someone is trying to decieve us, cause well it looks suprisingly similar to 302 2003.  :)   However I wouldn't be suprised if the abilities you listed are what your actuall robot can actually do.

Allison
I don't know how physical this years matches will be but last year we shattered the side of a lexan robot in our first practice match (they ran into us).  I still have a piece of it.

I would use wood and the aluminum for the kit.  You can definitely get something driving and it will cut down on the repairs you will have to do at competition.  You can compete if you can make something that can drive every match.
If the clip does pop out, can i just push it back in?  This happened to us and we think the shifter may be not engaging when it is supposed to be.  Is that related?


I have had the same problem.  However, I dont believe the aliases are wrong but rather the LEDs are incorrect.  Red now means the M+ is at 12v (M- gnd) and Green means M- is at 12V (M+ gnd).  I say this beacause I am using a single solenoid which is spring return, so I only power M+, which the red wire of the solenoid is hooked up to.  I simply toggle that relay's fwd bit to operate the solenoid and it works.  I would not go changing the polarity of your compressor because reverse polarity could seriously damage it.




I haven't hooked up a multimeter to the relays yet, but I'm almost 100% postive you're incorrect about this.  If this were true, it would imply that the robot controller not only tells the relay what polarity to set itself to, but what color to light the LED to.  This would require 4 bits of information to represent, and we're attaching the relay to the controller with 2 signal wires.  I seriously dobt they implemented a serial communication protocol between the controller and relay.

The claim you made holds some incredibly serious implications...  You might want to back such claims up in the future, because even though I'm sure you're wrong, I'm going to have to test this myself because it's not worth blowing out components a week before ship.


Honestly, I believe that at the end of it all, no one will give this topic a second look if team 254 and 60 aren't very successful this year. If they do manage to do very well, then everyone will be on them saying they were able to do so well because of an "unfair advantage they created by working in tandem with another team." If they manage to do well as an alliance, then everyone will be extremely bitter and take things to the FIRST level. There, thats a sweeping generalization for you, success driven prosecution. Not only does the aforesaid highlight why we really care about the collaboration of these teams, but it also highlights a problem I have noticed in alot of places, including FIRST: everyone has a knack for acting in their best interest, but not for acting with the intent of finding the most suitable compromise.





while i agree with the rest of your post i have to show an opposite side to this.  because Kingman and the Cheeseypoofs broght this up in such a dramatic fashion...i don't see it not becoming a national FIRST issue.  to me, your argument is like saying steroids are bad because they make people better athletes.  and if the people weren't better...we would't care.  that isn't true.  if the athletes weren't better kids wouldn't take them with such disregard for the future that they do...but steroids would still be incredibly harmfull.  successful or not, 60 and 254 are hitting uncharted (good? bad? who knows?) territory in FIRST that will almost have to be addressed.  i do, however, wish both teams the best of luck this season.  it would be kind of interesting to see them against each other at nationals.  it kind of (emphasize "kind of") reminds me of when 45 (another well recognized team) donated their 'toy'-robot (sorry...didn't have another word to use) to another team for use at a competition and wound up losing to it in a match.  it'll be interesting.
You can actually force balls in from the bottom when you already have 10 or so in there?  That's kind of surprising.


If you want it to move exactly 270 degrees, you will need some sort of feedback system.  I would recommend a pot - do you know how to wire one up?




You need to read the 2004 Programming Reference guide located here:
http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/2004_Programming_Reference_Guide_10-29-2003.pdf

You also need to read the 2004 FRC Default Code Reference Guide:
http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/FRC_RC_Default_Software_Ref_Guide_2004-1-7.pdf

The second PDF document explains in detail what's going on in the default code that Innovation First provides.

> I agree, if you absolutely must use a plastic, use lexan.

I disagree there are few other plastics that are better suited for a frame than lexan.  Polyethylene is probably one of the better plastics to use for frame materials.  It is easy to machine and very durable. The names to look for are HDPE (same stuff used in the fields) and UHMW.  My best guess is that the gearbox and mounts are some form of polyethylene.
Your in bad shape when the clip pops out.  This is what the rubber band is for and I urge everyone to use their.  We already lost a transmission because the zip ties we were using loosened up and the pin popped out and the place shifter broke.  Use the rubber band to hold the clips in place and use zip ties to keep the shifter in place.  It the clips do pop out you will have to look at the motor diagrams, I think their is on in the white paper, because I don't think it works quite right if you just pop the pin in.
Okay.  What do speed controllers and spikes look like, how do I explain to the team what they do, where can I get some, and how much do they cost.

Allison

PS- Sorry about asking so many questions but I really know nothing about electrical, and as I am the team leader I am expected to know something.


I thought you were so depressed from not being the current UFH anymore that you had to drown yourself in robot building.




Actually, I think I used Patriots Day as an excuse so that I didn't have to think of  3 Questions...im running out of them!  Be happy Joe...thats one less day everyone has to catch up to you!


Actually, it depends entirely on how long it takes to execute your Interupt Handler code.  If you keep triggering interupts before the last one finished, you end up interupting the interupt.  Do this too many times and you blow the stack and the thing crashes.

So, the REAL question is: How much time has IFI given us to service an interupt without blowing up their code?

Chow for now,
Steve




Interrupts are disabled while executing an interrupt handler.  This is why it's important to keep interrupt routines small, so you don't miss events.
heres a very helpful power point presentation by the people at Innovation First [http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/C_help.htm](http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/C_help.htm)
my team would also like one and will trade some of our extra stuff.

we have the one from this year that we plan to keep on the robot but we want an extra one to play with in the off season.
I would think so...But at what pressure?  Does it need to keep a certain pressure and force like it is for lifting?  I thought the tanks were like 16 cu. in. I not sure if that is together or by themselves.  And 3/4 of the 20 feet of tubing??!!
just look in your pneumatics box... if you see wires then these are what you are looking for. (they took me about a 30 minutes to find)
I finally decided to chime in on this issue.  Since I am part of this "conspiricy to undermine the values of FIRST" [/sarcasm], I decided to tell a few details that people not involved in this would not know.  This is not an attack on people or their arguements, but an attempt to straighten out a few facts.

The arm did not arrive in the mail at our lab pre-built.  The pieces that needed to be machined/welded were done, but we assembled it and fixed it. Some people may say that this trains us to be factory assembly line workers.  However, we helped design it, know how it works, and could put it together without instructions.  Secondly, It did not work right after we assembled it.  For example, We sheared the bolts holding the drive sprocket to the lower part of the arm, so we *engineered* a solution.  "We" means the people in team 254's lab at that moment (about 8 students, 1 engineer and **2** college students.  We then called Kingman and informed them of the problem, not the solution.  That is just one example.

Some people have said that we (the students) are not as invloved in the design process.  However, we had numerous hours of meetings discussing the design of the robot (for example, of the extensions for ball herding).  We met on Monday and spent two hours discussing different solutions to the problem that we saw.  We then compared our results with Kingman's results.  Then on Tuesday, we spent another two hours deciding which design (of our two favorites from Monday) we liked best.  Then, we called Kingman and it happened that we both agreed about the best solution to the problem (that we had room/weight/resources for).  Again, this is but one example.

Another thing people are saying is that we should do this with a rookie team.  We decided to collaborate with Kingman (and they with us) because we both felt that we had experiences to bring to the table.  We do mentor rookie teams, and I am not saying that we do not learn from them.  However, we feel that our strengths complement each other.

Thank you for all your feedback to our experiment.  Please try not to attack something you do not know all the details about.  However, continue to give your input, especially if you have something new to bring to the table.

Sorry for the long post.  This is a complicated subject. :ahh:
&lt;sarcasm&gt; These rubber bands serve a far more important purpose. They are to be used instead of screws, bolts, super glue, duct tape, or whatever you wanted to mount your motors with. This can be achieved by creating a simple figure 8 with the band, wrapping one side around the motor, and the other around some kind of shaft &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
Now while this may seem like a good idea, remember that rubber bands can snap really easily, so it's not advisable hehe.
You know, there's a couple of things I'd like to say about this...

- I can see where you're coming from. When I came back to the forums full-time, one of my early posts got negative criticism because they didn't like my style of writing. And I was pretty pissed...who are these people who never even knew me back then, and why are they allowed to say that my points aren't valid? I know a couple of older FIRSTers who graze the forums every now and then who have the same feelings towards reputation.

- People like to criticize more than they like to praise. We don't give eachother enough credit, and I wish it was different...but that's the way things are.

-I LOVE getting reps, especially from people I don't know and people with reps higher than my own. My face literally lights up *every single time* dlavery gives me positive reps...because I know my opinion mattered enough for him to make the couple of clicks and think of something interesting to say to cheer me on.

So...maybe some solutions? I know! Mid-Season Resolutions!
-**I resolve to give out more reputation.** My favorite area of the reputation area is the comment area. If you've recieved a rep from me lately, I try to always put in a word or two either of praise or of ways to make it more palatable (lately it's been a LOT of words!).

-**I also resolve to not give out negative feedback without a comment.** This way we know what we're doing wrong, as opposed to knowing someone thinks we're wrong but didn't care enough to say why. It also makes us think before making those couple of clicks.

Dont be scared away from posting. Voicing our opinions is what makes us human, voicing our opinion frequently is what makes us FIRSTers. :D  And you definitely have valid points to make, so if we all resolve (or at least keep in mind) to show eachother that we appreciate one another, I think that we're well on our way.

Hope that helps!
Looks nice but expecially in the first scene there needs to be some light work done. But great job!
Couldn't a woman stop her?
It says in the document not to restructure.  We took this to mean that we could not change the font, margins, or add more than three lines to each section.  However, we did add a space between each section to make it more readable.  Have you asked on the Q&A if you can change margins/font?

Thanks,
Most likely Autodesk has just taken them off Steamline to clear room, because I don't see 103's form on there either, and I remember that one being on there for sure while we uploaded ours.

If you get a response back from Autodesk, let us know, but I'm not too worried since our team number's folder is still there in that animation submition folder.
Yes... they're custom made, but's a little hard to do, and we're already in test phasis.
i've already looked at it but it's a BIMBA ORDER form, i was looking for SMS order form.


You MUST use the ground stud as a gatherer for all the incoming grounds.



Apparently not, from the Q&A today:

> Q:	According to the "robot power distribution diagram", all ground wires go thru the ground stud. R44 allows connecting directly to the fuse panels. Can we loop from panel to panel (as shown for the red+) or is the ground stud required?
> A:	Either way is acceptable.
hmmm, i wasnt aware of that update.. thanks for keeping an eye out!
is that a real pic for the white board? or was it just some quick mspaint work?
I tested the relays with the multimeter - when I set relay1_fwd to 1, the spike turns red and the multimeter reads -12v.  When relay1_rev is 1, it's green and the multimeter reads 12v.  This seems backwards to me...


It's hard to predict what the weather is going to be in a months time. By the way the North East has been lately, I would suggest dressing warmly, looking at temperatures probably between 40F-60F, but it's still a month away. This is based on how the winter and weather have been recently though.




40-60 that would be a heat wave where I am.  I will deffinately be bringing shorts and t-shirts.... And maybe a few pairs of pants just in case. :yikes:
RAGE team 173 - www.rage173.org
hehe, Jon, on a side note, you guys ready for the snow we're gonna get tonight?
I think they retail for $120 or so each, but I'm sure some teams will have extra 883s which can no longer be used in competition, but are fine for everything but the latest drill and chiaphua motors.  The Victor is a square base with a LED on it, and a mini tower coming up with a fan mounted at the top.  The SPIKE is a little box which has either a red or blue SPIKE label on the top.  Both are labeled very prominently, so if you see one you'll know it.
Are those things omnidirve?  And what motors are you using?  I only see Globes.
im not particuarly for or against this topic. This is new territory in FIRST, and should be treated that way: a new and developing idea that has not had enough time yet to prove its effectiveness/diseffectiveness. It could turn out these 2 teams rule the game this year. Or, it could turn out neither do good because of a design flaw, and arent picked for finals by other teams just for the fact that they worked together (therefore cutting the work in half?) This is probably a unlikely situtation, but just for the record (this has nothing to do with this thread):

If you are in the position to pick teams for finals, pick them by who will bring the most to the table in your alliance, not their teams repuatation of being good or how much they tried selling themselves to you.
In the updates it shows that it is NOT RECOMMENDED to replace the blue wires. The reason being, is the heat it takes to solder can damage the brush housings inside the drill motor. It is advised that you can crimp/solder 10 guage wire onto the existing cables if you need extend the wire.

And please, this topic has been discussed many times, please search before you most. Thank you.


We do mentor rookie teams, and I am not saying that we do not learn from them.  However, we feel that our strengths complement each other.




I think that's where people see a problem/the controversy, Matt. The collaboration seems to have been made to increase the overall strength of both teams - teams that are already very strong and able, with a plethora of awards in their cabinets. That seems very different to me from mentoring a rookie team and providing them the necessary knowledge to make it through the build season and competition season. Based on what you said above, one scenario is to 'combine powers' (for lack of a better phrase) while the other is to teach.

> Really? Where?

Read the comic. :rolleyes: It is unedited.  The one thing that amazed me was a preverted baby that stuffed it's face in Tea's chest.  Go to your local Waldbaums or Walmart and pick up Shohen Jump. That contains five comics and they are generally all good comics.
I think the most important thing to notice on the rep points box is the choices are

I approve

or

I disapprove

it says nothing about whether you AGREE with the post or not.

A forum is a place for people to publically express their ideas and opinions, observations, and to interact with others they would not normally have access to.

If every thread started out with the first person making a comment, and everyone else chiming in that they agree - there would be no point in having the forum.

people will have differences of opinion and different ways of seeing things. I wont give anyone negative rep points unless they are rude, abusive, vulgar, or attacking someone personally.

think about the words "good repuation" and "bad reputation" when giving points - people have the right to disagree with you, if they do so in a civil manner - that should not earn them a bad reputation.

If I disagree with someones post I have sometimes given them postitive points, but put a comment in that I dont agree with them. I still approve of them making their views known, and esp appreciate someone taking a stand on a difficult subject (not that there have been any on here lately :c)

PS - scare me away? I think if my rep points went seriously negative I would conclude that I am not wanted here, and in that case, yes - I would stop posting on CD.
Not to sound critical or mean or insulting, but 123 posts in 2 days? Am I the only one that sees this as beating a dead horse? I think possibly every scenario has been covered, and no offense to anyone, but I personally don't think there's anything that needs to be said on this topic.
ya we kinda removed the blue wire and replaced it with the 10 guage wire and blew out 2 or 3 drill motors.....so that shipment of a half dozen drilll motors was nice  :yikes:
Remember people, if it's not recomended by FIRST, there's a pretty good chance they have a good reason for it :)
thats amazing =D as long as u canpick them up and shoot them back down that is a great job right there.  i know a lot of people who are ignoring the small ball part of the game will love to be alligned w/ you
They have the drill motors inside the lower section.  You can see the back of the drill motor through the holes in the gearbox.  I think I see FP motors in there as well.  /powah

maybe the 124th post will be the one that sheds light on the topic...i feel as if the discussion is going great.  if you don't like it...stop reading the thread.  don't take this as "insulting" it's very simple.  there are some people who could discuss this till the cows come home and i'm perfectly willing to let them.  besides: some of the FIRST/CD heavyweights haven't put their input in yet (whether they will or not i don't know) but i'd like to see where they stand.  final thought:  FINALLY a thread where we can have real non-bashing discussion.  it's kind of exciting. :)
who was the guy in the patent office that wanted to close it down, something like a hundred years ago, because he thought all the possible new inventions had already been thought of?

there are over 900 teams this year, with a total of how many people? 20,000? 30,000?

This is a real difficult subject here - a real can of worms. Its going to be hard for all the teams to figure out how they feel about this - and I can understand people wanting to close the door here and end the discussion.

But that will  only push the confusion and hurt feelings off the forum, where people wont be able to talk openly about them, and then they will fester until the regionals start.
Yay!  We're at 100,000 points!  That is correct.


If you do indeed want to use it to line up your robot, here's another alternative that works great. Just grab a sharpie, align it properly on a practice field, and draw a dark black line right above where the white tape is. Worked great for us last year, we never once missed the bins throughout all 3 of our competitions (gyro-based also, but proper placement was critical)



Thanks for the suggestion! It sounds like an excellent idea.
So to sum it up, FIRST doesn't want you to do it, but there is no rule that says you cannot do it.  I personally wouldn't recomend it.  FIRST reccomends that you leave at least 1.5 inches of blue wire on.
I apoligize for what I said earlier. I'm just a person that feels a topic can be discussed so many times before it starts to lose meaning. Many people on here may disagree with me about that, and they're welcome to, it's there opinions. I just want to apoligize if I offended anyone on my thread. I am sincerely sorry.

Also, this year, there is a total of 1497 teams registered. That means that given a team has 15-20 members (rough estimate), that gives us 22,455 to 29,940 give or take opinions.
Wow, I sure hoped we didn't make any of the wrong (same) assumption as 217.  I hope we can get this tested soon, but since we are mostly manufacturing everthing ourselves it has been a slow process.  Two items in Paul's post I don't understand though:  1)  The reaction force is from the Sun and ext. gear pinion and the motors which are attached to a housing and chassis.  2)  How can you have the same output torque at different speed ratios - where is the energy going?  To this second question it could go into backdriving the other motor.  But we designed the gearing so that they should output the same torque at stall.  We are also planning to connect a current sensor on the motors to detect when they are backdriven.

If it all goes bad - we do have a backup transmission ready (but it's so darn heavy!!)
Is that a previous year's robot I see in the background?  Or do you guys have more than 1?  Or did you have a scrimmage this weekend so other robots were present?  Basically....what is up with that other robot in the background?
Those Go-L computers are miserable.  Blech.

I'd like an Athlon64 3400+, a Matrox Parhelia, 3 21" Samsung Syncmasters.  It'd be nice to have no wires at all.  Wireless monitors, wireless keyboard and mouse, wireless speakers, bluetooth printer.  It'd be nice if games would span two monitors.  That'd be awesome.

I must say I'm relatively happy with my XP3000+ and radeon 9700 pro.  The only upgrades I'd really like to do is double the RAM to put a gig in it and upgrade to a 9800xt.  I won't be doing that for a while, though.
This may be oversimplified, but all you have to do is use a PWM output as a function of a joystick input. something like pwm(#)=p2_y; (or whatever port your joystick is in). U can even use the Limit_Mix function so that it reads pwm(#)=Limit_Mix(2000+p2_y);

edit: Actually if you are using a joystick, all you have to do is plug it into port2 on the OI, and ur speed controller for the globe into PWM OUT 2 and you are set to go. The y-axis controls the arm. (Default code can do wonders lol)
The second screenshot from the bottom looks really familiar. Is there something wrong with my memory, or exactly same monitor with exactly same robot in inventor image was in an animation last year?
Yes, you can use anything so long as it can be seen 100 feet away. Well you cant use tape, as the only tape we are allowed to use is with the electronics.
Or I could just buy the SMC "off the shelf" three stage solenoid...

That's what I thought too thanks :D
This is a great example of a solid working design. Great great job guys!!!
How is your drive working out? Have you had any issues w/ the 2 casters up front?
Just curious, looks great!
We haven't tryied to hang on the bar holding anything.  :)
1) '95
2) Total Points in the seeding rounds
3) highest big ball in goal


Another update posted.  We were told that there was some trouble in opening the latest version of the database on computers running Windows 2000, ME, 97, etc.  That should be fixed and there are a few new items that we input.  If anyone really has any items they are putting on theirs, email them to us so we can put them on the master.  [email]weights@cyberblue234.com[/email]





I can't open the latest version on windows 2000 with Excel 2000. I hadn't tried any of the other ones, so I don't know if this is a new problem or not.
this is way off the subject, but who has asked first about this situation, I've searched the q+a section multiple times, but I can't find the question.  can anyone conferm that the question has actually been asked?  or are we all waiting for FIRST to take the initiative?
OK thanks.  And when we put these on the robot, We wire the motors to the victors/spikes and the victors/spikes to the RC?
Being a 13 year team, we have lots of old robots hanging around the shop.  One thing we don't have is the time or energy to build a second robot.  We're going to ship, take finals, then hit regionals the first two weekends.  Building a second robot is completely out of our sight...

We'll be heading to the UTC Scrimmage this weekend (feb 21st) to see how well the 'bot fairs in competition.
Like I said in the last post; all is not lost.  After I posted, I went to your website and looked at your Inventor picture of the transmission.  You ARE making the same assumptions as we did.  Your gear ratio from the drill motor is way too low and it will backdrive or stay at stall and trip breakers.  My biggest suggestion to you is when you are driving at slow speed, turn off the drill motor and have a way to keep the ring gear from spinning.  If you spin both motors in opposite directions, make sure the drill motor can't overrun because you will actually start driving backwards.  Your config as shown will provide a VERY fast high speed, but you need to handle the stall torque of the drill motor at slow speed.

You can e-mail me and I will give you my phone number if oyu would like to discuss it.

A nice electrical diagram put out by FIRST can really help you out a lot:
http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/2004_Power_Distribution_Diagram_rev0120704.pdf
Ours is nowhere to be seen neither and
I.
Am.
Freaking.
Out!
I thought I put it up Sunday and now it's nowhere to be seen.
This is horrible. :(
I don't think I'd choose any of those.  Mandrake and Redhat are pretty hard to really slim down to run on an older computer.  Gentoo would be really annoying as most people choose to compile it from scratch, which would take a few days for a p133 to get a working system.  I'd choose Debian or Slackware since those can be exceptionally light-weight setups.
Actually, if you follow the flow chart, you cannot use any off the shelf solenoids.

Electronics (yes) -&gt; Is the part a motor, **solenoid**, pump, or other actuator? (yes) -&gt; No, it may not be used.
As far as I know, neither team 254 nor team 60 has asked FIRST about the legality of our collaboration.  Since I would probably be the one to do that for my team, I know we have not done so.  If another team has asked, I have not heard about it.

We obviously think that we have not violated any rules in letter or spirit.  Some people disagree with us.  We'll see what FIRST officially says.
the bot looks way cool.  the fact that you are done already makes me envious :D   another question... what are you planning to do if someone hits your arm while it's down?? (I am not threatening) :ahh:
that was something our team had a huge problem with
By my calculations, you can get just one cycle in and out at 60psi.  The next one will be at greatly reduced pressure.
The Clippard tanks are 16 cu in each.  That piston should take at most 14.1 cu in for an extend, and slightly less for a retract.  thus, after one cycle, the air in the volume tanks will be at 60 psi, thanks to one of those nitfy gas laws whose name I can't remember.  P1*V1=P2*V2.  And I'm ignoring the volume of the tubes, as it is relatively negligible at this scale.

If you want to get all those shifts out of the 2 tanks, turn your regulator down to 40-45 psi.  That should get you exactly that many shifts out of your piston.


It is relatively easy to make a continuously variable transmission if you are willing to turn a percentage of your power into heat.




Or generate electricity to charge a battery - like the Toyota Prius. Incidently, it uses a planetary gear system not unlike the one shown to split the power coming from the gasoline engine and simulateously drive the wheels and charge the battery.

Bring on the hybrid robots...

Judge Judy.. hmm.. Isnt that a stupid name to have?
Thanks DJ.
So to make sure I have this all right.

The two 3/8" drill motors each go to a victor 883.  The victors connet to the circcuit breaker (same this as a fuse box?).

The two van door motors are the same as the drills- motors to victors to circuit breaker.

The two window motors each go to a spike which connects to the circuit breaker.

For the pnuematics, both the solenoid and the compressor connect to spikes.
-Are the spikes really necessary?
-Why do the solenoids we have have four wires each? Do they all connect to one spike, or do we need two spikes for each solenoid?

More questions.
-Do we need more than one circuit breaker?
-How do we connect the Circuit Breaker to the RC?
-Can the 2004 EDU RC handle all that, or do we need to connect that stuff to the old full size RC?

Hello all,

is it against the rules if you wanted to mechanically acuate the end of an air cylinder in order to create a vacuum?

that's all



I am 99% sure this is okay.  I am certain it was last year, but since we have no need for it this year, I didn't keep the info in my head.

Best I can do.

Joe J.

P.S. ... I hated myself for the above answer, so I decided to look it up...  ...processing...

couldn't find it in the rules, but according the the Q&A section (search for "vacuum") I think it IS legal:

Section:5.7.2   Status:Answered   Date Answered:1/20/2004 **Q:**It is it legal to make a mechanical device like a syringe to evacuate air out of an area so as to create a vacuum, thereby taking advantage of atmospheric pressure when attaching to balls?**A:**Yes, it is legal.
Im pretty sure the default code already has PWMs and relay outputs that are programmed to stop if certain digital input pins are pulled low by an external switch.

From the top of my head, I think relay out 8 is tied to digital input 16? intended to be used with the compressor and the pressure limit switch? - that would be a good example of how to start.
we are trying to use limit switch as interrupts... and when the arm hits the switch, it will stop moving, that's our plan :)
I'll tell you this right now.  I very rarely (if at all) give out rep.  I don't even look at rep.  It's all the way on the right side of the page, after all.  I can glance through posts without looking at any green whatsoever.  Besides, why should someone with 10 green dots be taken more seriously than someone with one green (or heck, even still on gray) when at face value, all their opinions are very valid.  In which case I'm forced to think who deserves my rep.  Does that person with 10 dots deserve it more simply because he has the 10 dots.  Maybe I should give a leg-up to the person with 1.  If it goes to the person with 10, it's a popularity thing.  If I go to the 1, it's a pity thing.  Maybe I give it to both, but that almost defeats the purpose of the system.

And then there's bad rep.  I myself have gotten bad rep based on Jeopardy questions.  How wrong is that?  If someone only adds one line to a discussion, should I give him bad rep?  I mean, he **is** adding to the discussion after all.  Should all posts under one line be judged as bad?  There may be valid opinions in that one line.  Maybe someone double posts (which is very often by accident).  Should they be penalized for that?  I don't agree with a post?  Bad rep? (I'd never give out bad rep because someone disagrees with me, but I'm sure it happens).  Someone has started flaming other users.  Should he be given bad rep?  Yes he should (sorry, just making sure you're still paying attention ;) ).  If someone pointlessly gives you bad rep, do you have the right to fire back at them (which is a dangerous thing considering a lot of people can fire a negative rep of 15 points)?

I speak my mind.  It's just who I am.  Which puts me between a rock and a hard place.  I want to get my opinion out there (i.e., speak my mind).  The problem is my opinion often differs from that of my peers (in this case, the users of CD).  I'm not afraid of bad rep, but I'd kinda like that bad rep to be justified.  Are you going to give me bad rep because I disagree with Operation Reelect- er, I mean Operation Iraqi Freedom?  Are you going to give me good rep because you're good friends with me?  Things like this have made me just disregard the entire rep system.

I'm not saying that rep is just a popularity contest, or a tool to keep political enimies (for lack of a better name) at bay.  You have no clue how tempted I was to fire a -15 bomb in the direction of the people who gave me bad rep based on Jeopardy questions.  I never did, but I wouldn't be suprised if that's another large source of bad rep.  I'm pretty sure that a lot of rep givin out is deserved either way.  But even if 90% of all rep givin out is justified (and IMO, it's probably less than that), that makes 10% of the system a popularity contest, and a way to oppress those that disagree with you.  And 10% of all the points givin out (or heck, lets count 10% of the people) is a lot of points (or people).  Again, I'm just speaking my mind.  I'll take you seriously even if you're in red.  And I won't let other people's opinions on you (in the form of rep), be them good or bad, influence how I feel about what you say.  You agree with me?  Cool.  You don't?  Maybe we can have a friendly debate on that topic.  Don't be afraid to post what's on your mind.  You'll never get bad rep from me if you do.

So, how 'bout them Red Sox?
I like the reputation system.  I think that being able to see who gave you the rep makes if very effective and stops it from becoming an abusive system (not that some people won't abuse it, but that's just reality).  I think it makes a lot of people stop and think before they dash off a harsh impulse post to something they take exception to since they know what they write will be "judged".  However, I find it hard to be that judge, so I've never given anything out but good rep, and that mostly to things that have made me laugh.

Regardless of whether you are posting in a controversial thread or not, there is always the chance someone will not be happy with what you said or how you said it.  Ken, didn't you get zinged for making a disparaging comment about Starbucks?  However, if you look at who is giving you good rep and bad rep, and the good rep is coming from the leaders of the rep pack, then you're doing something right and shouldn't be afraid of posting.  And I have to chime in and agree with Jessica, it's pretty darn peachy keen to get good rep from someone high up on the rep scale.  It's like, "Wow, Andy Baker liked that!"

&lt;==========&gt;
It's just a rumor that I've come by most of my rep points by making fun of Dave Lavery.  :p
next question: do you have the power to the relay connected correctly, and also the control cable.


Since the line is much less "Curvy" this year, line following could be optimized to go faster than last year. HOWEVER, I would strongly recommend against that if possible. In many applications, not just FIRST I have tried line following and have not been satisfied with the results. Most of the time it is either too slow or loses the line too easily. Granted, there are applications where line following IS a very viable option, but I'm pretty sure that this is not one of them, especially since FIRST gives you the sensors and code to use the IR beacons, especially since they seem determined to make sure they are fully utilized in the future. So, of course, ultimately it is up to the individual teams, but personally, if you ask me, then it is not your best option.





I made some tests following the line, actualy, many of them. The best results came out using six sensors! Use them in V, and put them as far as you can from the robot's rotation center, keeping a distance of 6'-7' between the center sensors, so the robot can go with two or three corrections only. In 30 times we got there everytime between 7 and 8 seconds, never loosing the line. The limit is your drive system!
the signal should be flashing on and off - remember, these are pulse signals so that the two beacons can be distinguishable. you'll need to use code that like on www.kevin.org/frc to record the pulses and translate them into an actual input of whether or not the beacon is seen.
Kingman has not asked the question we also do not believe it needed to be asked. This subject has obviously never come up before so I'm sure no one has asked the question.

If someone feels it necessary to ask the question, ask FIRST the question.

90% of the work done by Kingman on the (4) robots was done by students and the mentors. Laron only helped on a small portion of the welding no machining. We also had two other machine shops in Kingman (Brackett Aircraft and I-Corp Arizona) make some parts both companies donated the time and materials and work directly with our students to help inspire them. I-Corp is a direct competitor to Laron (how is that for cooperation).

If anyone feels we are breaking the rules then ask what ever question you want neither Kingman nor the Cheesy Poofs have anything to hide. We would like to show you exactly how we did it. Even if you don't agree you may learn something, and in the process I know we can learn from you.


P1*V1=P2*V2.  And I'm ignoring the volume of the tubes, as it is relatively negligible at this scale.





The equation is right, but you forgot the accumulators are at 120psi. I'm also not sure about your volume calculations. I thought the accumulators are 2" bore x 6" long, which gives 18.8 in^3. I could be wrong, but the answer won't be terribly different if they are 16 in^3

You use 14.1 in^3 (at 60 PSI) when you actuate the cylinder. The accumulators hold 37.6 in^3 (at 120 PSI). Since you are only using the air at 60 PSI, you effectively have 75.2 in^3 of air, and when you get down to 37.6 in^3, you will only have 60 PSI. Thus, you have 37.6 in^3 of air to work and can actuate the cylinder twice. If you can regulate the cylinder to 50 PSI, you could get 3 shots.
then you would probably need a single-edge based interrupt pin to determine when the circuit goes from open to closed.
i just wonder why it had to be two profound teams collaberting... its like kicking a man when he's down. it wouldnt be so bad if you helped an under-resourced team, but another established team? cmon, a little biased eh?


Yes, you can use anything so long as it can be seen 100 feet away. Well you cant use tape, as the only tape we are allowed to use is with the electronics.



Actually, I think you can use tape.  R14 does say you can't use tape other than electrical insulation, but I think if you are making a team number, it'd fall under the Non-Functional decoration rule (R-55-R60).  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
One thing I really enjoy about this discussion is how it has really brought our two teams closer together.  a unique bond is formed when a large number of people challenging us.  Thanks!  Thanks also to those who have supported our effort to expand the meaning of FIRST's coopertition.  We appreciate your support.

You can get into arguments about 'it's there to meet a rule requirement, so its therefor functional', but I think that is not the intent of the rule.  The intent is prevent using tape as a fastner.

I would think that using tape to make the team numbers would be fine.  Make sure there is contrast. :)

You can insert a manual override option to turn the compressor "Off" whenever you want to.  You can insert a manual override option to turn the compressor "On" whenever you want to, as long as it does not disable the automatic shut-off at 120psi.  E.g. you can turn the compressor "On" at any time, through manual or autonomous means, but the existing software that turns the compressor "Off" at 120psi must always take priority over all other functions.

hehe, Jon, on a side note, you guys ready for the snow we're gonna get tonight?



snow???? That is a news flash to me.... Goes and looks on weather.com bookmarked page for local area.....Huh just flurries up here too bad.


the bot looks way cool.  the fact that you are done already makes me envious :D   another question... what are you planning to do if someone hits your arm while it's down?? (I am not threatening) :ahh:
that was something our team had a huge problem with



depending the intensity of the impact in the arm it can break... but we want to stay with the arm in the back of the bot.
But is almost impossible to not hit in a bot...so we´re taking more arms to replace  :rolleyes:
Any other question...pls post  :yikes:
aww you guys are lucky, we're getting a fair ammount starting at 3am going into tommorow afternoon :/
how exactly does it get in the database?


It would be my interpretation that is would be perfectly legal.  IMHO the preople on these forums seem to like to shun that which they have not seen before or which in not commonplace, or is not specifically specified to be legla.  Look at the intention of the rules.  Somebody at the kickoff said somethign about not being lawyers here.  Use your common sense people.  Its not all that hard.




I've not seen anything in the rules THIS year about it (I'll re-read the Tournament tonight), but last year alignment aides were specificly illegal to help place the robot.  The wooden angle and other sighting devices were not allowed, but landmarks on the robot itself were.




And It didn't directly effect the outcome of the match at all. It simply helped the drivers align with objects on the field.





It only made it easier for the driver to pick up bins, increasing the multiplier, so it didn't affect the outcome of the match?
:confused:

I think I have to disagree with Andy over the idea that all criticism should be sent through PM's.  I think we all can learn quite a bit from good criticism and there's something that we can all contribute to it.  The opportunity is lost if it's not constructive criticism.




I agree with that to an extent. We all can learn from criticism. Last year Matt Reiland of 226 (I think it was him) saved our butts because in one of our teasers we had a pneumatic cylinder held in place illegally, if it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't have realized it and it would have caused quite a bit of embarrassment if an inspector caught it at a regional or at the championship. Also, just this last week Paul Copioli from 217 pointed out a flawed assumption about a CVT design. That will probably save headaches and pain for that team because of that. Another good example of good criticism. I agree that certain criticisms should be posted, but again with everything you have to draw a line somewhere. As everyone else before me said use your head before you post it and if you are in doubt, I say go ahead and PM, if something good comes out of it or a problem is solved the team you helped will let you know. You all have them, so use your brains.
Where is everyone emailing their forms to because the one I posted on Saturday has gone missing?

Hows that DeWalt chopsaw working for you?  We've had to take apart the switch on ours a few times since we got it in 2001.

Also, any plans to shield that controller?  It looks rather exposed, and they will break when they take a good hit.  :(

Otherwise, I thought that there wouldn't be enough room to pickup enough balls to be worth the effort of a hopper.  Perhaps I was wrong...

Have your primary FIRST contact enter the URL to your team's entry into the TIMS. If you view the team list for a regional you are attending and your team's name links to the website you want entered into the website competition, then you know FIRST has received the correct information.
it would be much simpler to have the line of code that is controlling the motor also look at the limit switch on a digital input pin, instead of using interrupts

this is not really an interrupt application, because you are controlling the motor output on every loop of your code anyway, there is no reason to interrupt the loop when the switch closes - the victors and spikes dont respond that fast.

besides, contact switches bounce when they open and close - which means, instead of simply going from 0 to 1, they go 0000111110011011010101111111111 - so for every switch closure you will see maybe 20 to 100 interrupts within several milliseconds.

alright, thanks, just wondering if that's all we had to do.  ^^

we are trying to use limit switch as interrupts... and when the arm hits the switch, it will stop moving, that's our plan :)



As Ken mentioned, this section from the FRC default code, user_routines.c, Default_Routine() does what you want. Each of the pwm outputs are stopped by a limit switch in either direction (min, max).

Those Go-L computers are miserable.  Blech.

I'd like an Athlon64 3400+, a Matrox Parhelia, 3 21" Samsung Syncmasters.  It'd be nice to have no wires at all.  Wireless monitors, wireless keyboard and mouse, wireless speakers, bluetooth printer.  It'd be nice if games would span two monitors.  That'd be awesome.

I must say I'm relatively happy with my XP3000+ and radeon 9700 pro.  The only upgrades I'd really like to do is double the RAM to put a gig in it and upgrade to a 9800xt.  I won't be doing that for a while, though.




Return to Castle Wolfenstien will give you perifial vison using three monitors with the Parhelia.  Or maybe it was some other game, but there are definatly games that will span three screens.

My XP 1800+ still putzes along just fine. :)

I had experince with the reputation system over at @Forums](http://209.123.85.43/) and I survived that so I'm not going to sweat the system here.
That being said, I still think it's nothing more than a poularity contest and a stupid one at that.
when you soldered the sensor to the wires, did you cross the wires over like it shows in the sensor drawings? if you plug them straight into a pwm cable, the wrong signals will be on the pins

if your sensor is on solid then something is wrong, you should get a pulse with a 10mS period if its seeing the beacon - BTW the beacon is very bright and bouces off walls in small rooms, people, boxes...  and covering it with your hand wont block the light. you really need to be out in a large open space to work with the IR system.
It sounds like you burned the sensor. You need to be very careful with heat around them. Always use a heat sink (an alligator clip works fine) between the soldering and the sensor, and use a low wattage soldering iron.
After reading this thread I can honestly say I'm more concerned with the unprofessinal comments coming from mentors and engineers that the actual subject matter of this discussion....You know who you are...comments like "But please stop and consider that there are a lot of us out here who do not copy everything you do, who are not following in your wake saying thankyouthankyouthankyou we could not do this without you"
Just what was this sarcastic comment trying to acheive? No one is forcing anything on any team. Run your team as you choose. Teams 254 and 60 have.  I certainly hope you have not "inspired" your students to follow with this attitude.

The comment about this collaboration resulting on students cheating on HS and college assignments.. Please, I think its an insult to FIRST students to imply they don't know difference between cheating on your homework or exams and collaborating on a project. I thought 'teamwork" is one if the building blocks of FIRST.
The comment regarding FIRST not being about making machinists and welders... Do you think these are somehow "bad" professions? Think before you post.

As for companies in the real world working together on the same product/project etc..
They do it all time. Check out www.unitedspacealliance.com. Two biggies who have obviously figured out the working together yields better results than working alone.

As for companies "going to market with the same product" and diminishing the "competitive nature". Again, think before you post. There is a whole market out there that is just this, its called generics. Generic drugs, foods, etc... And trust me, this market prompts alot of competition. But you know,this really doesn apply to this thread. The point I am tyring to make is that before you go off and say the "sky is falling" please do so in a rational, thought out manner with at least some evidence to justify yourself.
Please remember your posts here reflect on your entire team, like it or not.So think first , think again and then post.

but the existing software that turns the compressor "Off" at 120psi must always take priority over all other functions.

-dvae



The 120 psi is a hardware limit - the compressor has a relief valve.  Keeping it running will not charge it above 120psi unless you modify the compressor.

More questions.
-Do we need more than one circuit breaker?
-How do we connect the Circuit Breaker to the RC?
-Can the 2004 EDU RC handle all that, or do we need to connect that stuff to the old full size RC?

Allison



You must have 1 circuit breaker per powered part.  You do not connect each circuit breaker to the RC - only one 20 amp, which is used for powering the RC.  The EDU RC, I believe, will do fine.
Isn't that actually her real name?
one great thing about the rep points system is its a great way to toss a short comment of encouragement towards someone without having to post it, or send a PM - and I think it has really cut down on the one-line "me too" posts
Is your arm controller a scale model of the arm programmed so when the model is moved the robot arm moves in the exact same way? That'd be cool.
I only get reps from one person who will remain un-named.  First he gives me two bad reps as soon as I join and start posting for stupid stuff.  He said I didn't search before I posted a new thread... How is he going to tell me I didn't search?  Was he standing over my shoulder watching me?  I searched (Chief Deplhi and FIRST Q&A) before posting so I wouldn't get a bad rep.  I sent him a message and he gave me some good rep points to make up for it, but nows hes started doing it again.  I don't really like the system.  At least make it so that people have to explain why they gave you the bad rep. so you will know what you did wrong.  Now I have to go back and try to figure it out on my own...
I like the little wings on the sides. Ball corallers, no doubt. I don't see anything that could get you up the steps or onto the bar, though. I guess that's not part of your strategy?

I would think so. One of the hints given in the manual this year with respect to the website award is that the judges will expect the site to be up-to-date (seeing a website that hasn't been updated in 2 years may not give the best impression to the judges). So, go ahead and keep updating your website and making it better. However, there will come a time that the updates you perform on your website won't count towards your teams score for a specific regional--the judges will eventually visit your site and score it. Take a look at [section 8.8](http://www.team229.org/fm/8.8) of the manual for further clarification.

> Please remember your posts here reflect on your entire team, like it or not.So think first , think again and then post.


Too many teams try to rationalize what they do by tossing up things like "we post all our designs after the season, publish white papers..." as if that somehow makes the other things they are doing ok.

FIRST teams did not invent multi speed transmissions, multi motor drive systems, or shift on the fly drivetrains - I had a shift on the fly multispeed bicycle back in 1967

The POINT I was trying to make is that, just because your team has done very well in the past, or has raised the bar, or published white papers on all the neat stuff you have used, that doesnt make it ok for you to bend the rules, or to come up with clever ways that give you an unfair advantage over other teams this year.


90% of the work done by Kingman on the (4) robots was done by students and the mentors. Laron only helped on a small portion of the welding no machining. We also had two other machine shops in Kingman (Brackett Aircraft and I-Corp Arizona) make some parts both companies donated the time and materials




This is exactly the issue of concern.  I am not concerned with how much either team contributes to the community.   I am not concerned with the motivation behind the formation of the 'Bionic Poofs' manufacturing alliance.  I am not concerned with the impact that said alliance has had on the students on these teams.  I am not concerned with the challenges associated with multi-team design and build.

I am concerned with the rules of the competition that relate directly and unambiguously to the situation described by Glenn in the quote above and in the previous posts by team 60 and team 254 members.

The rules clearly state that work done on the robot by non-team members must be billed against the $3500 limit, whether that work was donated, bought, or bartered.  The situation at hand is that roughly half of team 60's robot was built by people who are not members of team 60, and roughly half of team 254's robot was built by people who are not members of team 254.

If both teams have billed every thing according to the rules, **and** both teams' robots are not in violation of the $3500 rule (and the $400 rule), then there is no problem with what they've done.  In fact, if that is the case they've made an amazing accomplishment.

On the other hand, if they are not billing non-team labor against their $3500 budget, or if they are billing it and exceed $3500 / $400 for the robot / individual part, then they are clearly in violation of both the spirit and the letter of the rules.  I believe that their alliance affords both teams a significant competitive advangage vs. every other team that designed and built their whole robot with only the resources that their team had secured.  I believe the $3500 rule is in place to limit exactly this kind of imbalance.

The only grey area that exists with respect to the rules is the notion of one or more persons having dual team affiliation.  To my knowledge there is no provision for such dual team membership in any official FIRST document.  Likewise, I know of no official FIRST document which forbids dual team membership.  This is something that I believe should have been cleared up before kickoff, or ASAP thereafter.

One thing I really enjoy about this discussion is how it has really brought our two teams closer together. a unique bond is formed when a large number of people attack us. Thanks! Thanks also to those who have supported our effort to expand the meaning of FIRST's coopertition. We appreciate your support.


I haven't seen any posts 'attacking' either of your teams, persay. In fact, I think the posts have been, for the most part, good-natured. You shouldn't label a post as an 'attack' because it may express an opposing viewpoint. You should embrace the criticism. And to all of the people complaining that this thread should be closed: If every controversial thread were closed, this forum would be downright boring. Until there's a blatant insult towards either of the teams involved, or any other team, for that matter, I see no reason to shut this one down.

Is that a previous year's robot I see in the background?



Not quite...

Reputation points don't really bother me.  This is mostly because I've been posting on here since the old forums (no, the old, old forums; the ones Brandon wrote).  It is, however, interesting to see who has reputation and who doesn't.  For some people, reputation is highly deserved.  I'm not so convinced that others deserve the reputation they have.  Either way, it can (doesn't mean it will, just that it can) start to approximate a popularity contest and I'm wary of those to begin with.

Thanks DJ.
So to make sure I have this all right.

The two 3/8" drill motors each go to a victor 883.  The victors connet to the circcuit breaker (same this as a fuse box?).

The two van door motors are the same as the drills- motors to victors to circuit breaker.

The two window motors each go to a spike which connects to the circuit breaker.

For the pnuematics, both the solenoid and the compressor connect to spikes.
-Are the spikes really necessary?
-Why do the solenoids we have have four wires each? Do they all connect to one spike, or do we need two spikes for each solenoid?

More questions.
-Do we need more than one circuit breaker?
-How do we connect the Circuit Breaker to the RC?
-Can the 2004 EDU RC handle all that, or do we need to connect that stuff to the old full size RC?

Allison



Not to be pedantic but you can't use Victor 883's.  You need to use Victor 884's (which have been available for the last two years).

As for the spikes connected to the pneumatics, yes they are necessary.  Without the spikes it would be impossible to switch the compressor and the solenoids on and off.

You most definitely need more than one circuit breaker.  Each Victor gets placed on its own circuit breaker.  If the Victor is driving a drill motor or a CIM motor, it should be attached to one of the 40 amp circuit breakers.  For any of the other motors, it should be attached to a 30 amp circuit breaker.  The spikes which drive motors are connected to 30 amp circuit breakers while the spikes connected to solonoids are connected to a 20 amp breaker.  The robot controller is a 20 amp breaker.

To connect a circuit breaker to the RC, you need to put the circuit breaker in series with the positive power terminal for the RC.

You need to use the full size RC on this year's robot.  You can't use the EDU RC.

No offense, John.
Just mentioning a process is being made.
We'll be looking you up next year when you guys come up to Rochester in 2005 (you are comming, right?).



John claimed 229 would be there when I talked to him about it.  He also offered his services as a head ref but I figured it was a bit too soon to commit.

Matt
hmm... are you planning on dumping into you ball chute or OOB?
How many of you have played with Windows NT on an Alpha? They were amongst the most amazing systems ever. I had the chance to play with one for a while, and very few systems I have seen were as responsive as that one.

Personally, I am very happy with my current system, while its not a "dream" system. Those who know much of computers will be amused, as it is a Pentium 166MHz, mmx system, 64mb of pc66, and 19.2gb of disk space. And did I mention the Radeon 7500 and the SB Audigy? =)

It works for what I use it for - and can even run Inventor and Jedi Knight at reasonable speed. But it is not an Alpha, which would qualify as a dream system.
I met John Just over four years ago when I first joined 151. Since then I have learned so many things from him I have lost count. When were having an argument on which way would be better to do soemthing, John would come up with some easier that both sides would agree on. He is an amazing engineer and and amazing leader. I am extrememly glad that he has been given this award and I wish him nothing but but good on his future endavors.

Congrats John on winning UFH.

well, most of the code is contained in tracker.c and navigate.c - there shouldn't be too many modifications.

first, navigate uses pwms 3 and 4, whereas the default code uses 1 and 2 - you'll need to reconcile this.

second, the call to navigate should go in User_Autonomous_Code.
I've reuploaded the file again.  It is being saved as a Microsoft Excel 97-2002 & 5.0/95 Workbook.  That should work.  If it isn't, I'm not exactly sure why this isn't working so please let me know if you have any idea on how to fix the problem.  Thanks.

there's another reason why it may be leaking, when you have the black gasket and you are assembling the solenoid make sure that the a side lines up with a and b with b. there are little letters that help you to line them up, we had ours hooked up backwards and when we reset it it stopped leaking


I tested the relays with the multimeter - when I set relay1_fwd to 1, the spike turns red and the multimeter reads -12v.  When relay1_rev is 1, it's green and the multimeter reads 12v.  This seems backwards to me...




I also checked a relay with a multimeter today (as I said I would last night) and came the to the same conclusion as steven114.  With relay5_fwd set to 1  (relay5_rev = 0 and LED was red), the multimeter common probe on the M- of the spike connected to relay output 5, and the multimeter voltage postive probe connected to M+, the multimeter read -12V.  The relay output cable was connected correctly.  I also checked the same spike with the common probe on ground.  I read 12v on the M- and 0v on the M+.   It seems that the IFI aliases are incorrect.

I was wrong about this and my sincere apology to anyone I may have confused.  My knowledge of the matter was based on a false assumption.  The single solenoid I was basing this on was wired to the M- of the Spike.  It was the only one of our 5 solenoids (2 double, 3 single) wired without an external ground (it has been rewired now).

I have rewritten ifi_aliases.h to change the aliases from fwd to rev and visa versa.  I loaded the modified program into my bot and confirmed that relay 5 (my compresser) was getting +12V.  A zip file with my new ifi_aliases.h file is attached to this post.  Hope it helps.  I am posting from MOE HQ workshop (not my dorm as usual) so I have get back to work now.  Once again I'm sorry.<br><br><a class='attachment' href='/uploads/default/original/3X/8/a/8aa49fce9415ed07ad14da552075c89938a132ec.zip'>ifi_aliases.zip</a> (2.56 KB)<br><br><br><a class='attachment' href='/uploads/default/original/3X/8/a/8aa49fce9415ed07ad14da552075c89938a132ec.zip'>ifi_aliases.zip</a> (2.56 KB)<br>
Maybe it's just me, but I think that the negativity is due (in a very LARGE part) to the end of the season rush.  Even though I love being involved in FIRST, there have been a few times this week that I've wished that I had the entire week to myself...a chance to relax, instead of rushing to finish a project.  As a result of that, I've been a bit irritable at times, especially when I realize just how much work is left for us to do.  I know I'm not the only one that's in this boat, and that might be part of where the negativity has stemmed from.

Then again, that's just my two cents...
how sturdy is it while hanging, it looks vulnereable how it looks in the pic


where are you located? i might be able to mail your our extra from last year.

they defently came in the kit though, they are very small so keep one of the new guys looking.





we are using two of them so we would need 4 of the connectors.

We're in Irvine California and we'd pay for shipping and might be able to give you something in return?  :yikes: ?

Thanks for the offer
Those are just beautiful. :-)
I think you look at this as though it was easy, it wasn’t it was difficult. If we were to do this again next year we have several “lessons learn” to improve our process.

Our hope is that we can show what we did and how we did it to any team that is interested. If other team uses some of our methods they will improve the process and more people that get involved the better we will all are at competing in this game.

I can’t see it working for more than two to three teams in a group given the obstacles to over come. Most teams will not be able to make a process like this work at all and will be more successful on their own. Others may improve there program by new innovative systems such as this.

When I say game I don’t just mean Regionals or Nationals I mean the whole process. We are learning about Free Enterprise. We have to market ourselves to gain sponsorship and raise money, we have to share our wealth with other team to inspire them to grow there business. We have to find designers, machinists, welders, and painters, truckers, and so on to help us complete or task.

No matter what each year each team should do everything it can to make there program stronger and every year we will all be a little better than the year before. Most of the rookie teams are starting off better than we did when we were a rookie because we can give them more tools to work with than there we just a few years ago.

How do we finance, design, manufacture, and ship this product in six weeks? How do we make ourselves as competitive as we can be? We innovate and we learn new ways of doing business. FIRST students have the advantage of learning this years before there time. Some people never learn this in a lifetime and others only years after they are out of school.

This years game is tough, and the game will be won by the best alliance not the best robot. In my opinion the robot design only equates to 25% of the winning alliance. The other 75% rests with the alliances themselves, strategy, and luck.

We are talking about two teams with nearly identical robots out of 900 plus teams do you really think this is going to turn the FIRST world upside down? Do you think this really gives us an unfair advantage?

use a peice of PVC pipe as a tensioner...run a bolt through it and bolt it to the frame
Can I just say that that bot is the most awesome piece of machinery ever seen yet. There are so many words to describe it, some very descriptive others quite 'colorful'. Question: Which regional(s) is your team going to? I'd love to see the thing in person.
Heh, that reminds me of the lexan control box we made for the 2002 season. It wasn't fun trying to get that thing on an airplane, let me tell you.

This year?  No.  Future years?  Absolutely.  If this practice is allowed to continue unrestricted, the FIRST Robotics Competition could change dramatically (for the worse, IMHO).



Do you think this really gives us an unfair advantage?



Yes, if it has allowed circumvention of the $3500/$400 limit,  I do.
The scars on those wedge plates just scream, "Stack Attack"
See photo gallery Dale(engr] 2004 robots 2-17,
IR hooded receivers top/bottom (in sockets)

Use of PWM cable requires the Red & Black pins reversed prior to soldering.

For test purposes
construct a special male to male PWM cable
and plug-in the receivers in to test.
I use a PWM "Y" insert
with the 2nd male end flared for observation with the scope probe & gnd.

(a current limited +5v power supply may be substituted for the DIG IN side
power (red/black) set to ~.05A, receivers need ~5mA .005A
for bullet proof protection while testing)

The Vishay 34840 & 4840 receivers do not respond to continuous (DC) IR.

The IR Beacon must pulse at 40kHz +-~2kHz, (50-50 duty cycle).

The receiver very selectively accepts only 40 kHz on=off pulsed IR,
rejecting  less than ~38kHz or greater than ~42kHz or continuous IR (DC)

Correct Pulses are provided by the EDU controller with Beacon code running.

The best way to observe proper Receiver operation is with an **oscilloscope.**
see photo gallery Dale(engr] 2004 Beacon scope waveforms

Probe the 4840 Output pin:
with no pulsed IR present, voltage level is a constant +5vDC,

when 40 kHz is detected, level is 0v (ground) for 1 ms or 2 ms
"this is called active LOW" and what we look for in the code

then back high for the remainder of the period - 9mS or 8 ms,

The cycle repeates every 10mS (100Hz)

The scope is also a good way to view fidelity of the IR signal.
Reflections/weakness often show up as shorter irratic and/or dropout pulses.

Observe care to avoid:
Output pin to +5v shorts when 40kHz IR is active
as this may damage them (we have 3 dead)

(see previous post: the output voltage never goes below ~2.5v

In this fault there is a negative going pulse upon detection, but it's
truncated, i.e. stops short of 0V.
The DIG INP requires the voltage level to go
less than ~.5V [TBD] to signal IR pulses detected.)

Note that a DMM does not give a clear 0V reading in the presence of pulsed IR
due to the short duty cycle, the average is close to +5v (= no IR state)
but a small but discernable decrease from 5v can be seen.

(even with a strong signal the output Voltage is high (+5V)
90% (2ms) to 95% (1ms) of the cycle)
I agree, and I highly doubt that plumber's wrench is part of the design process :)

Freaking.
Out!
I thought I put it up Sunday and now it's nowhere to be seen.
This is horrible. :(




Ed, take a deep breath. If you know you uploaded is on Sunday, then you did.  Again, I speculate Autodesk is removing forms off Steamline to make more room for teams since the folder was full at one point. Check the folder that's for submitting your final animation and see if your team number is there.  If not, I would suggset e-mailing autodesk and asking them if they are removing forms to make room.  If other FIRST-ers are deleting them, that's an incredibly ungracious move by them... but we can't be held accountable for others' actions.  If you uploaded your form, you shouldn't be liable from that point on.
I just wanted to chime in on this subject one last time.

I suppose the thing that upsets me most about this thread is not the fact that people disagree or even disapprove of what our two teams have accomplished this season, but more so having to once again witness the obvious double standards that exist not only in the world of FIRST, but in the world in general.

It seems we are allowed to help teams that we know we can beat or that pose no threat to the other “powerhouse teams”. I have seen this time and again, teams are willing to help out the rookies or even other veteran teams that seem to be struggling. But very few are willing to extend help to another team of equal “powerhouse” caliber. I’m not saying that none will (in fact both 25 and 79 have helped us with quite a bit with our drive train research), but it certainly isn’t given as freely as it is to those that struggle. Mind you, I’m not saying that we should stop helping rookies and start building monsters, what I mean to say is that there are plenty of opportunities to help everyone.

I have seen numerous posts chastising our two teams because we could have used our resources to help out some rookie teams rather than each other. I would like to again point out the fact that both of our teams do mentor rookie teams. In fact our team has helped to start FIRST programs in several states in which FIRST did not even exist.

Additionally, between the two of us we provided 100% of the machine shop support at 3-4 regionals last year (not sure if Kingman did one or two) and provided additional support at Nationals (Texas is a long way to drag a trailer from California!). When you consider this, bare in mind that at that time we were in no way obligated to share our resources. FIRST has recently changed the rules (perhaps because we lead the way in that respect as well) so that now if a team wants to bring their own mobile machine shop they have to support other teams. I think this is a wonderful rule, and I’m sure you will see many teams doing just that this year. However we did it because we wanted to, not because we had to. In fact this year we will be providing machine shop support not only at the two regionals we will be attending, but also for at least one regional at which we are not even registered.

I would also like to point out that we are not teams of unlimited resources! Our team came from very humble beginnings (please feel free to research it it’s a great story!), and presently we have only one actual engineer and two engineering students (I list my team role as engineer because it best describes what I do for our team, although I won’t receive my degree until this May). Kingman has zero engineers and a couple of machinists (albeit darn good ones). As such our combined resources are much less than those of many of the teams we compete with, but we still find a way to help literally hundreds of teams.

During this past year our two teams tried something new. Our initial intent was not to build identical robots, that just kind of happened. Our intent was simply to build the best robots we could, to give our kids the best experience we could along the way, and hopefully to blaze a trail into a new and undiscovered world of FIRST where everyone helps everyone. If you find some flaws in our first attempt please don’t hold that against us, our intensions were as noble as could be.

I still feel that collaboration is a good thing; the sharing of ideas and resources is always a good thing. I am also sure that our teams will continue to work together in the future and I hope others do the same. We’ve already been down the road where the veteran teams help the new teams all the while guarding their best secrets to maintain an edge. Let’s turn the corner and see what lies down this new road where there are no secrets. Where everyone shares everything willingly and gives aid to others without bias. We are trying to turn that corner and yes there may be a few bumps, but never the less we still want to find out where the road goes.

And to those of you who find fault with this, you have every right to question our actions, but please don’t question our motives.

I have to go now we have a robot to build.

Good luck to all,


Dennis Jenks
I will confirm, this Americanized version of the Shonen Jump is not half bad... it has Sandman and the best manga of all time - One Piece.  Yu Yu Hakusho isn't bad either.  It just kinda makes me mad that they used the title "Shonen Jump" from the original title in Japan, which isn't really anything like this American book o' Manga.


..."ya think he's compensating for something?"




Try "Oh my...."  ;)
I would just like to point out that few posts have said anything negative about 254 or 60.  We do not question your teams' contribution towards FIRST.  However, this concept of collaboration is new to us.  You guys have had a much longer time to think this through.  We are only questioning the idea, not your team's integrity.  Please don't mistake an attack on the idea as an attack on your team.  Besides, few of us are concerned with what you did.  We're concerned with what other teams may do with the idea you have presented.  Personally, I'm glad you opened this "can of worms."  That doesn't mean I fully agree with what it may lead to.


I've reuploaded the file again.  It is being saved as a Microsoft Excel 97-2002 & 5.0/95 Workbook.  That should work.  If it isn't, I'm not exactly sure why this isn't working so please let me know if you have any idea on how to fix the problem.





Still won't open for me. However, I was able to open it in gnumeric on linux, so it must be triggering some type of odd bug in excel or windows.

You need to use the full size RC on this year's robot.  You can't use the EDU RC.

We're not officialy competing because we couldn't get our registration fee, but we decided to build a robot for practice, because we plan to compete in '05.  Well actually, It's not just for practice, but we haven't released other plans for it yet, because they're not all ready.  OUr drill motors are the old 3/8" ones, so we were going to use the Victor 883's because we were kinda hoping that there might be another team that could lend them to us, because we can't afford them.  Also, we have and old Full Size RC, but we're using the EDU one  for most stuff (we're using the Full Size for the OI and the EDU for everything else) because it would be a waste of time for our programmer to learn P-basic for the Full Size RC.  Thanks for your help.

As in reputation i have gotten many good ones for this thread and i did not intend this thread to do  that i just wanted to bring this up cause it bothers me and i got a negative rep for this thread which said

"Learn to proofread. If you could post sentences that made since, then people would not negative rep you"

I mean this is a reason i dont like to post it feels so good to get good reputation because it shows that someone is getting somethign out of what you post, but i mean when something like this comes along it makes me want to stop.  I do not  really pay attention to gramatical errors i mean sure i try to put periods were they belong. I do not excel in english that is not my strong point but thats the reason i am in FIRST is cause i enjoy science and generally understand it and LOVE TO BUILD STUFF. I really dont care about my reputation but to get negative just because maybe i misspell somethign is stupid, it should be on the content of the post


I agree with that to an extent. We all can learn from criticism. Last year Matt Reiland of 226 (I think it was him) saved our butts because in one of our teasers we had a pneumatic cylinder held in place illegally, if it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't have realized it and it would have caused quite a bit of embarrassment if an inspector caught it at a regional or at the championship. Also, just this last week Paul Copioli from 217 pointed out a flawed assumption about a CVT design. That will probably save headaches and pain for that team because of that. Another good example of good criticism. I agree that certain criticisms should be posted, but again with everything you have to draw a line somewhere. As everyone else before me said use your head before you post it and if you are in doubt, I say go ahead and PM, if something good comes out of it or a problem is solved the team you helped will let you know. You all have them, so use your brains.




In cases where criticism is needed, it is important to post it to the thread and not PM for everyone can realize the design flaw and learn from it.  Teams that robot get criticized in a positive manner appreciate it more than they are embarassed by the bad assumption they made.  Just be careful with everything you post.  It is easy to not sometimes but posting positive criticism helps everyone reading that thread.

I think Andy is saying that the 'That sux' and other posts like that need to stop. CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is needed. It's the one-liners that add nothing to the disucssion that needs to end.
What is "Entire Metal Box"?
I find it amusing that team members from 60 and 254 continue to skirt the main flaw in the collaboration.

I applaud your community spirit, your outreach effort, your philanthropic endeavours, your hard work, and I appreciate the learning journey that each team experienced.  But I think you're changing the subject because you're uncomfortable with confronting the reality of the rules.

C'mon now.....Give us a straight answer.  The rules require that the robot must be designed AND BUILT by members of your team.  Otherwise, the contracted work MUST be valued per the rules and be within the $3,500 limit.

How are you going to address this graciously and professionally???

My guess is the box of metal parts they gave us.  The aluminum 2x3 and other metal parts.

i totally agree . you guys have already  made the robots now its time to stop beatin around the bush and get down into seeing if this is legal

I personally think they will allow it htis year but next year be very clear in the rules about teams and calboration
Rule 5.3.2.2 make it clear:
Build your own robot and robot parts. If you're not going to build your own, or are unable to, and none of your sponsors is going to build them, you need to have that maching cost go on the bill of materials.

It's been said that 90% of these parts were made by students or engineers, not the mutual machining sponsor.

The way it's written, (and assuming equal distribution), 45% of the parts on each robot need to be billed out.

Last year, we had Truck Town Thunder generously volunteer to fabricate two large pieces on our robot that took 6 or 7 hours to machine each. They didn't charge us, but we billed out each of those pieces at $50 an hour, for a total of $700 against our $3,500. It's the way the cookies crumbled.

Glen and Dennis and many other team members have mentioned time and time again all of the sincerely wonderful services these teams provide for ALL teams in FIRST. You speak of the noble intentions you had with this new idea. They said that students have learned a lot more than they would otherwise. This is wonderful and greatly appreciated. Honestly. **I, for one, have NO doubts about your good intentions**.

But intentions are mutually exclusive to the rules of the game.

This is **OBVIOUSLY** a grey area. Pick the shade of grey you like, but this is something that's revolutionary and pushing the envelope. It's not written in the rules. There will be a ruling by FIRST on this.

If you're trying to convince everyone on this board that the rules are **100% **clear on this sort of colaboration and that a special ruling won't be needed, you're just kidding yourself.

*Someone should have asked FIRST for clarity before this was done (not after) and I don't think it's fair to the individuals in FIRST to put them in this sort of a bind.*

However, the situation is already at hand. If we want to keep this discussion worthwhile, let's put the facts (rules) before us about it. Personal attacks, sincerity of intentions, and the fact that the manufacturing has already occured should have no bearing on the rules.

**There's a few issues at hand:**
**1.** Can one student be a member of two or more teams?
**2.** How should this billing situation (if needed) be resolved?
**3.** What's the defintion a sponsor?

Let's keep to those and other related topics.

Good luck everybody,

Matt
Look for an SMC distributor near you.  That would probably be fastest. They can tel yu the part number you need ad get it to you quick.
Yeah, my forms aren't up there either and I posted them Friday all filled out (I checked them over like 20 times to make sure nothing got missed) I've e-mailed their support e-mail before and never had any response.
To quickly address something in your post ..

I may see how hard it is to put a hack in vB3 to disallow reputation in certain forums.  (game forum, chit chat(?), etc..)  I'm not sure if this will solve anything, though .. any comments?


I was working on the IR's and came up with a couple of questions that i need help with!!! The first thing that i have to ask is that when i had a sensor working, the signal on dashboard viewer was not solid it would either flash on and off or it would just be solid off! I don't think this should be happening so could you give me a hand.
The second thing is that I soldered one of these vishay sensors to a pwm cable and then the sensor imput was solid green no matter where the sensor was facing, covered or not.
How are other teams attaching thier sensors to the controller?? I tried a pwm cable that i took of the male end and I soldered the wire to the pins of the connector, and the problem I had was the imput always on (possibly from the heat!)
Can anyone tell me how they are attaching thier sensors and any other help on these sensors would be appreciated!!!

Well, at least the question has been submitted to FIRST.  I didn't post it, but kudos to whoever did.

Yea this is annoying...i spent a lot of time trying to post them yesterday and i believe the server went down...but its a holiday so tech support is gone...so we sent autodesk and email and were FINALLY able to post it today.  i really hope that they dont disqualify us on a stupid thing like that...i mean how un-FIRST like is that?
Have the teams kept accurate logs of labor hours should these hours be included?
Another solution that does not involve changing you robot dimensions or wheels is to place more wieight on either the front or rear wheels. If either end has more weight than the other, you will be able to turn easier because the heavy end will have more traction than the light end, and will be able to slide the light wheels around the corner.
I really doubt that it was someone who was just being malicious, I think they'd find it odd if only one team had an entry form. They pulled down all of the forms that were posted previous to Sunday, so that makes me think they cleared house and dumped them somewhere offline. They really need to lock the files once they are uploaded.
My MX700 batteries last for over 24 hours of normal use.  I also have dozens of other recharable double-a batteries floating around and a spare wireless mouse that can use the MX700's base station receiver.  I'm am so well-prepared :D

I don't really see how the reputation system benefits us. Sure, it helps to discern who is helpful around here, but that should be fairly evident anyway. Also, I haven't seen anyone with a negative reputation, so it seems to be less of a matter of who has *more* reputation rather than who has good reputation. This pretty much boils down to who posts more and has more of an opportunity to have their posts seen and appreciated.

However, my feelings on the reputation system's existence are fairly neutral. I don't care that it's there, nor would I care much if it was to be eliminated.
I found this also.  What does it really mean???  I'll let the debate continue.
I personlly think this is a very important discussion to have.  The outcome will forever change the face of FIRST (IMHO).

Q: What constitutes a "Team Member"? Your example in the 4th bullet states"...If the machine shop were part of the team, its labor cost would not apply."

A: A team member is one that is afforded all of the rights and priveleges of all team members, including being listed in your literature and on your tee shirts (we encourage teams with large memberships).

how did you make those wheels. OR did you buy them?
here's a corrected version of the schematic. Our skilled engineers (students) actually got working on our pnuematics board. includes relief valves to prevent overpressures on the exhaust side.

Some joker labeled the actual part **DeSqoq**. Let's hope that doesn't turn out to be more accurate than **qoqDeS**...




Who are you calling joker? lol. ;) I'm glad that Alan has taught me so much about "labeling!"
It is 16 cu in for each tank..I read that in the manual kit of parts.  As for acuation.  The easiest answer is not to rely on equations and just test it.
Brandon ya it sounds good to try to take it out of certain forums but dont kill yourself

And like i said again its not that big of deal to me. I mean i do not like seeing negative rep.

I just get excited when i see liek good repuataion from people like any of the kens,Andy baker, dave lavery and countless other ones. I mean i am 17 years old i turn 18 in less then a month. I have just started touching the engineering outlook. These guys i have name have been in engineering for years. ONE EVEN WORKS ON THE ROBOT ON MARS! To get one of your post or threads noticed by these guys is amazing. When i see a good rep from them its just something that gets me excited about robotics even more. I think everyone can agree with me when you get a good rep from them it feels good because they are the leaders, mentors and people that have changed our lives in many ways.
The sun only shines as long as you believe that it does. Be happy, as long as you keep your hopes up and never give up its all good. Youll get somehting out of this experience, even if it isn't what you expect to get out of it. If you need any help you can call teams around your area. In SoCal teams are always on the phone with each other and mentors going back and forth. Your team isn't alone, you have the whole FIRST community on your side.
*please don't give me anything negative for this one!*

I am a little lost also on the reputation system. I posted a simple response on the "What are you listening to..?" thread, and suddenly, someone gives me a negative point for saying the title and artist. Nothing provacative. Why is this?

We are using pneumatic go-kart racing slicks again this year but upgrading to 12".  If you are looking for traction these are superior.  If you are looking to not cry when you put your robot on a scale find another source.  They weigh like six pounds each.  And we are using four in a four wheel drive skid steer setup.  No one is pushing us off a six inch step...Unless we do it to ourselves. Lol.
Quickest way is to lose some traction from one end or the other.  Any chance at resurfacing one set of wheels with something slipprier?  Possibly the edge profile is very square and sharp, and will snag more than slide when you are trying to pivot sideways.  If you can bevel one or both sets of wheels to a more rounded profile it could help.  We did the 2:1 gearbox last year and had to combine one pair of the sticky pneumatic Skyway wheels with one pair of the (slipprier) Polyurethane wheels, but it was still very difficult to turn with about an 18 inch wheelbase.  It required a different driving style.  Sometimes we had to actually reverse one side while driving forward on the other in order to get it to turn.  I couldn't get it to turn well while driving normally, but some could do it while another sat on top...on pavement!

Beautiful craftsmanship on your robot, by the way.  Love it!
I have tried to get the servo working.

Our code is set up so when i plug  in pwms for motors they run. i inserted the servo code as a motor. pwm03 is the servo:

pwm03 = 200;


the servo is plugged in to the  output 3 but does not move. i read the forums, and i see that they only run off the backup battery. is this true?
Just in case you haven't seen it stickied to the top, you might all want to read [this](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25464).   I was a little dismayed at the direction this thread was going a few pages back.  Fortunately, things seem to be on the upswing again, and for that I thank the people who have been reasonable and rational, no matter which position they take in this discussion.  To those that have not, just know that we're watching.  It would be a shame to end a discussion of such gravity simply because a few people can't refrain from speaking without thinking first.
Okay.

Time to step back, and take a break.

This thread was originally very constructive, but it is rapidly turning into a mob with pitchforks.

Brandon -- I am locking this thread for a few hours.  To be reopened at your discretion.

Everyone needs to cool down, on both sides.

I won't stand by and see these 2 teams who are "pillars of FIRST" that I happen to know and greatly respect be torn apart... regardless of whether their actions are right or wrong (I'm not passing judgement), we need to keep in mind that these teams are definitely the "right stuff" and have had great positive impacts on FIRST itself, and certainly on thier students.

We may decide their actions are wrong.  We may hear from FIRST that this is illegal.  We may condemn them for their actions... but... we won't attack these two teams, and their members.

Chew on that for a while... then try for some more rational discussion.

Personally I don't follow the rep points too much. It is nice to read the ones you got and to realize you helped someone or some team and that you had made a difference. I also rarely give out reputation and when I do it's because I feel the person has significantly helped me, my team, and/or the entire CD community in general. To date I have never given out negative rep.

It's been said in previous posts and I'll say it again, no matter what you do not everyone will agree with you and you MUST respect that. The same goes for YOU not agreeing with everyone else.
I think reputations points will allow new/inexperienced delphi users to find the information they need from good sources. They can see someone has a good reputation so obviously their opinion on fixing a problem is more valued, because they are known for good advice. On thing that should be changed is that if you give negative reputation points it should be required you leave a comment as to why you feel the person deserved it. That way the person recieving negative points can fix what the problem is in future posts. This will also discourage users from abusing the point system.

Hybrid robots?  What's the hybrid part of it? Electical and Electrical?

First of all, I do not think you will actually be able to charge your battery by any significant amount, if at all.

Motor D: Drive Motor
Motor G: Generator Effect

Motor D has 2 places where it's torque is being used.  Motor G and the wheel(s) it is powering.  Each provides a different load on the motor.  The motor can only provide x output, whereas power to G + Wheels = D output.  Also, for D to power G, D must have an input power source (from the battery).


|BATT|--RES-- M ]--***--[Wheel]
|                 |
------RES------- G ]


The circuit would look something like this.  RES being electrical resistances, *** is Resistance from friction within the gearbox (although relativly low).   The loads upon M are outward from that.  Anywho..  the turning of G is a load on M, so any electrical force created from G will be less than what is given to M.  So the Net electricity used will be lower.  BUT...  to have equal output to the wheel, (as if G was not attached) more current must be supplied to M.

All in all..  we don't have the tools for perpetual motion.

In the hybrid cars, inertial force is used to generate electricity as well as the gas motor, which is not driven by the electrical motor.

First stated to save weight, you may remove some of the fuse panels on the maxi panel breaker, they each connect by 2 or 4 screws on the bottom side.  At competition, you should always have your removed panels for replacment.




Those (copper? Brass?) things in the fues block are HEAVY!

If you seeo ur other pics, you will notice that we are using 2x drill and 0x CIM this year, and so we took them out.  We also found out that running the black wires through the empty slots in the fuseblock was the most elegant and shortest way to do it . . . a win-win, especially since its legal.

About those program/tether ports: the wires are near enough the board that we can get to them, and they are on the side which makes access really really easy.

About the switch: I don't know why there isn't a hole over it now.  There will be soon.

I was just saying that be did in fact get through inspection ok with it. It was determined to be legal.
I agree that you should check with FIRST first to make sure it's ok this year.
But if it's just for alignment, I also agree that you don't need a light. Just something to line up on the line with.
what you actually need to do is define the macro "_SIMULATOR" - hence the #ifndef lines around that particular loop. there are certain parts of the code that will get stuck without that macro defined. just go into the mplab project settings window and look for where you can define preprocessor macros, and add _SIMULATOR to the list.

yes...charging the battery we'll leave to the charger....the only time the chip motor would generate energy is when its being backdriven by the drill motor...but w/ current sensors that shouldn't happen...the second it starts to backdrive it will lower the drills speed and up the chips...we'll also keep the amt of power going to the chip a bit higher than drill (although we might not be able to go full speed from a stand still!)

Good sources?  I think just about everyone on here is a good source.  If they don't know - than they probally won't post.  If they do post something - i have only seen good.

I don't really care for the points.  I guess they are more or less a quest for attention.  I am pretty neutral about mine.  Points are kinda pointless to me - i have been here since before vB - so i could see them go or stay...

Personally, the rep system amuses me. I look at my list and say - "Lol! That person needs to chill." I deserve some of the negative rep I've gotten but some are just ludicrous (and thus highly amusing). I just sent an IM to Brandon to reinstate some rep because someone removed some points because I posted in a chit-chat thread (Dream Computer) that was a year old(Reason: "sorry..old thread..."). I've also GOTTEN points for posting in Word Association. I've also lost some because I posted my opinions in the "Music" thread (I don't care if you disagree with my tastes - DEAL WITH IT). Lol &lt;-- All I can say.
Ok, some updates (and a shameless bump, though I do hate double-posting)

We have a sprocket drilled out to fit our turret shaft.  The big (3") hole visible in the motor plate is for a FP motor, and the sprocket will fit inside the robot on the big pole, and be driven by the FP motor.  thus we can turn our arm around and around.  More difficult to build, but it should be awesome to have the driver park the both and let the arm operator do his thing, without all the inefficiencies that happen in less-thatn-perectly trained teams.

Driving is becoming harder with the arm, but it is still much faster and handels much better than our 2003 robot.  It requires experience, though. The dedicated freshman can tip it over while driving, although all of us were putting it through a stress test and he is the only one who almost made it flip.  Inexperienced as he was, he reacted fast enough to save it.  Maybe he has potential as a driver, but not this year.  If it goes over without something else causing it, its our driver's fault.  Hopefully we will get one smart enough to know whats what.  Turning with the marbles is great, although we may look into non-glass replacements.  Its gotta be something with balls, though, its just too funny of an idea.  Back to the point of this paragraph: as of now the controls for the arm aren't finished, so the arm is unpowered when we drive.  Therefore it has a tendency to flop around some, especially the rotating (turret) part of is which is not connected to a motor, so if the driver makes the wrong move, the arm freewheels around the robot.  No major problems, but its something we are keeping an eye on.

The claw is marching steadily towards completetiong (especially because we still have 9 days till ship!) and I don't think there will be a problem with that, but then I did design it and I am building it, so I may not be that objective.  Everything works so far.

I hope to get some more time with that hand-grinder soon and do that finish.  Its ridiculously cool.  I hung that one sample peice from the ceiling of our room with a few zip-ties.  Its our substitute for art.  Or maybe its our art.  Maybe.

Well, theres the update.  Hopefully more pics tommorow.  Anyone know where I can host ~5meg divX files, I took some of them and would like to show them off.

VERY COOL!
are those some crazy omni wheels i see??
Yes, I was going by what was said in the manual as well.  And the 16 figure is on Clippard's website as well, so I can only assume it's closer to being correct.  So I went with the 16 figure and didn't bother with a calculator.  I just estimated it out.  Yes, figuring that 32in^3 at 120 PSI is effectively 64in^3 at 60 PSI minus the 32 that must be left in the tanks.  so 1 cycle of extend retract.  or 2 shots by your counting method.  I whipped out a calculator later and 45psi seemed about right for 4 shots.
If you are using skid-steer as in 2 wheels and 2 skids, your problem may be that you dont have enough weight on the drive wheels.  If you can shift some weight over to them, you will get better traction.

Looks like a swerve drive to me...the globes are probably only for turning

one question....why not have seperate gear boxes and run Bevel gears to the wheels? this way you can have shifting swerve steer.... i was thinking about that a while ago but we decided not to use swerve this year.

I must say tho.....this is one of the slickest swerve gearboxes i've seen...ditto on the slick part


It is both, yet neither. :P




Stop stealing my lines.
The reputation system is really not all that different than the spotlight. It's nice to be recognized for what you say but it shouldn't govern how you think around here. You got something on your mind? Say it. Whether or not it earns you positive or negative rep points, it's your mind. Don't compromise it for the sake of approval.

As it looks like FIRST could be lacking a large amount of spares at the regionals, I think it would be great if teams shipped their entire collection of motors along with their robots.  If you're not using a motor, bring it along with you.  There's enough teams at every regional, that, statistically, they should be able to provide spares for any motor in the kit if everyone did this.

Everyone at FIRST competitions is willing to help out other teams, I think it might just require a little foresight this year to do it effectively.

To me rep points are like cliques at school in the fact that, like others said, you don't need somebody elses opinion to know that you believe in what you said.

If you can't post your mind because you're scared of negative reps, then you really need to start taking this less seriously. You can't make everybody happy. (However, you can get close.  ;))


If you are using skid-steer as in 2 wheels and 2 skids, your problem may be that you dont have enough weight on the drive wheels.  If you can shift some weight over to them, you will get better traction.



I assure you most of our weight is over the drive wheels.
yea, it isnt shiny as in shiny, but shiny as in woah, sweet!

nah, it isnt planetary... in fact it only has 1 sprocket
This sounds like a question for the FIRST Q&A.  I think disassembling the systems and putting one together and changing out cause the other isn't working....  well I think that's the lawyerism that FIRST is discouraging this year, as the other system is clearly interchangeable and such and should therefore be weighed with the robot.  Having it disassembled is just trying to get around the rule.

That being said, why can't you change them out during practice rounds and decide which one you want there?  It's perfectly legal if you pick one before inspection and stick with that one through the competition.

Why not try zip ties? They're cheap, slick, durable, and quick to install!



It may sound bad but it truly works...or at least it did for my team.but of course if you can find an Omni or more torque in your drive you would want to go with that and only use zip ties in a last minute, between matches solution

Kevin here have the right answer.  Your robot do not need to pass inspection to go to practice round on Thursday.  So take advantage of that opportunity to try out both device, and choose the appropiate one for your robot.  After doing so, understand that you cannot change your mind and decide to use the other device on the robot.

You may only use whatever components you included in the weight in during competition, and their replacement parts.
ok, where do i put the coin in and where does the coffee come out???
Come on Joe, there were more then that.
that answers that question, but what level of fabrication can we do at the competition, can we basically change our whole design if we find that neither work as we expected?
nice rollers!

how well is that key slot going to hold up? It looks like you guys sandwiched the rollers in between 2 plates... sweet!


I assure you most of our weight is over the drive wheels.


If you can go to a 14 inch Wheel, skyway has a tube and tire kit that fits on the 12 wheel hub, it is wider and has pretty aggressive tread.  This will also make your bot faster, 12.5inch to 14 inch.  They also were selling the whole thing filled and assembled. The part number for the whole tire and wheel is WHL1250 Sub 300-8 The part number for the tire only, you still have to get a inner tube, is Tire 2062 I don't have notes on the  inner tube.  Good luck BTW some of the pics in posted of this years bots have the 14 inch tires.
What tire pressure are you using?  Gearing?  Be more specific and we'll see what we can advise.


that answers that question, but what level of fabrication can we do at the competition, can we basically change our whole design if we find that neither work as we expected?




I believe the answer to that question is you may change the design of your robot before weight in.  After weight in, you have to stick with your decision.  The level of fabrication you can do at the competition is stated in the rule book.  You may use the machine shop on site, and make parts with whatever raw material you bring to the competition.
where did you get the rollers?
Why not simply try it?

BTW, if you mean 3/4 of the tubing in the kit is on the 120 PSI side of your regulator, then you are clearly using the tubing as a storage device, and this is not allowed.

The rules state that only the tanks may be used as storage devices, and one of the Q & A answers stated that excess tubing was not allowed for compressed air storage.

Yes, we would like larger tanks as well...

Tire pressure.  We tried deflating the tires.  Gearing?  Don't remember of the top of my head. We have the Chips and Drill combined on each side of the bot.  I want to say somehing around 30:1 from the drills and the chips are matched at free speed to the drills.


If we use the default code to run our robot, how do we incorporate navigate to run the ir sensors in autonomous mode?

If you can make it simple, I would appreciate it. I'm just a fabricator who got elected to program the bot.



It was talked about here [thread]216607[/thread].
In addition to those instructions you'll also need the navigate.c and navigate.h files, and you'll need to add a call to navigate() to the User_Autonomous_Code() routine in the user_routines_fast.c file.

Hmm i have heard that alot recently.  We have a grinder that hates one of the other students.  It has an insatiable(sp?) hunger for bits of keyway.


My favorite quote was posted somewhere around here and it wnet somehing liek this:  "everyone knows the best way to lighten a robot is to turn is over, shake vigorously, and throw awa ywhatever falls out".  Last year we had a nutdriver that someone clumsily dropped into an upright piece of our frame stuck in our robot the entire season until a few weeks ago when it was finally missed and so we got it out.
You want to know what the weather in March in New Jersey will be like?

The weather on any day in NJ is directly related to the digit of pi which corresponds to the date on which this said weather is required. :]

Actually, like people above said, it could be cold, and there is a small chance of snow (we have actually had snow as late as April, if i remember right). However, knowing March, there will be plenty of wind. It will be cold. Heavy jackets are recommended, along with gloves and hats (just in case).

And btw, I second what Mr.Holton said - NJ is truly amazing - We have a town named Brick right next to a town named Wall. And we have Double Trouble.

I've been averaging over 10 hours per day..but I'm a college student and only work weekends.  17 1/2 hours (8:30 am-2:30 am) last Saturday but we got it hanging.  I guess 2 1/2 hours were on Sunday to be technical.


Is that the Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am? I feel old, I remember when that movie came out! :p
The gray cable duct was a great idea. We use the same stuff at work and it's great for keeping it neat and it's also quick to add or change stuff in it by just snapping the cover (top) off.



That would be it.  Our student controls team captain is a big fan of late 70's Trans Am's.  Why, I don't know.  That's our Paco.

the tether worked thanks
The planned schedule for us has ben 10-8 on the weekends and 4-8 every other day. But, as the due date gets closer and closer the nights get later and later. This friday and Saturday ought to be all nighters. We have to be readyu for the practice comp that the SCRRF is holding...


*Wonders if we will ever make it*
We can do it, I know we can!


Come on Joe, there were more then that.





Ok there was more Mike here it is.

"Steve is this your music?"   " Yes.  Why?"  "Because it sucks."

"Did I zap you, dude?"  "Yes!"  "I'm sorry dude. I thought I just crossed the leads."

Why is everything falling off?

hahahah thats so great. It's really funny because it's true.

> The simple tasks:
> 1."fetch" (please be specific as to whether you meant drill bit or mill bit)
> 2."hold this for me"
> 3."get out of the way" (please be kind to our freshmen when using this one)


That is so true...
We meet and build about 10 hours a week.  We do have a few more sessions in the late season, but we're always a wee bit behind.  We might spend a bit more time if you count cleanup time in the shop, but that's about it.
The latest our team has ever worked is 7pm because our teachers don't want to stay late, and by then we getting a little bit hungery



the servo is plugged in to the  output 3 but does not move. i read the forums, and i see that they only run off the backup battery. is this true?




Yes. That information is also on page 4 of the RC reference guide from Innovation First.
2-8 peopel after school till about 5:30 on weekdays and about 12:00am to somewhere around 6:00 on weekends.  We will prollyu stayu longer now that time is gettign shorter.  Last year we pulled a few really late nighters. I miss those. lol. (has no life)

My thoughts on reputation points:
I do not think people should be able to give out negative reputation points, since this is not in the spirit of FIRST.  FIRSTers should be giving out positive reputation or not give reputation to a post, not criticizing people for what they write/post in these fourms.
Most people seem to have close to the same story. Last year i was a freshmen but i knew most of the senoirs, i was still stuck with simple tasks(check out "Freshmen Positives" for more on that). generally the whole team was run by 3 tyrannical (shall i say triumverate?) senoirs. This year a whole lot changed (and not just the fact of no longer being a freshmen). The tyranny is gone and all that is left in its path is a working domacracy(spell check please). It's taken us some time to get us back on our feet but we are a more efficient working machine(in my eyes). Anyways, i hope to see you guys at nationals next year as i plan we will qualify once again(does this guy use too many parenthesis or what?) say hello when u see team 701!
First off let me say I am not an active member of Team 60 still, so I don’t know every detail, nor will I pretend that I know everything about this year’s robot or team.  At first glance it seems that there are a lot of angry people in the FIRST community, but then upon a second reflection I realized these people are not angry… just ignorant, ignorance is a person’s worst enemy.  Those of you who are part of the large wave of antipathy in disagreement over the innovative ideas of Teams 60 and 254 need to again realize what FIRST is… a GAME.  I believe you are all loosing site on what this competition is all about.  Many of you incorrectly believe that FIRST is a competition where students MUST be the sole contributors to building the robots.  If you are one of these people I am sorry that you haven’t yet grasped the full meaning of FIRST and let me quote the FIRST web site as I did 2 years ago when this same topic was brought up. “The FIRST Robotics Competition is an exciting, multinational competition that teams professionals and young people to solve an engineering design problem in an intense and competitive way.”

Secondly, it was very clear what Glenn posted as to what the ratio of student machined parts to professionally machined parts was…I believe 9-1.  Or as he stated 90% of all the parts were fabricated by the team.  Now I can tell you from past years experience that a group of students are not capable of doing every task on a piece of machinery such as a robot.  They should not be expected to experiment with welding or other similar tasks.  That would be careless and dangerous.  So I fully believe that 10% of the work was done outside of the team, as it should have been.

Again quoting the FIRST web page, “Involved engineers experience again many of the reasons they chose engineering as a profession, and the companies they work for contribute to the community while they prepare and create their future workforce.”  Now, that is what FIRST has written as to what the competition is.  That being said I would like to know what engineers  or any business professional work alone in their respective fields?  Why then are people criticizing these two remarkable teams on cooperating? Doesn’t that qualify as preparing the future work force?

Lastly these two teams did NOT have to post anything about their robots or release pictures to anyone.  I bet many of you posting negative comments have not let any information out about what your robots are like or what they do.  Teams 60 and 254 have become known in the past few years for graciously posting pictures and information about their robots, and many around FIRST look forward to seeing the production pics of these robots.  The simple gesture of posting these pictures on the internet shows that these two teams are ALL about cooperation and inspiring the FIRST community.  I encourage all of you to not degrade these teams for their willingness to share their ideas.  I know that this will not impact many of you who believe this will “reck” FIRST.  I’m not sure how some of you call yourselves true FIRST participants if you honestly believe that teamwork and cooperation will ruin FIRST.  This all goes back to my first point, that ignorance is one’s worst enemy.  People oppose change because they are ignorant to the future.  I challenge all of you to learn more about these two landmark FIRST teams before you rudely call for their demise.

My hats off to 60 and 254 for again adding new innovation to the FIRST community.  And on a side note despite all this criticism I would like to say thank you to perhaps two of the most under appreciated men in FIRST, Glenn and George for everything they taught me over my duration in FIRST.  These two gentlemen taught me things that I will be able to use for the rest of my life, and for that I will be forever grateful.  So thank you for inspiring me to continually come up with new and innovative ideas.

having them look for nonexistant parts is also fun ie: a metric cresent wrench
but seriously we need them if we want this organization to continue
What was Star Trek? Who were Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Lieuteneant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols)?
I'm only at 4.xxx% poser! Surprised me that it was so low. :]
Where did that come from?
NO WAY!! Im so glad I finally get to see the robot.  Now I can have time to plan all our strategies to beat them. YES! ty 302, you guys are the best!  Can you get more pictures though? im kinda confused on that how that wrench thingy works. hmmmm ill have to sleep on it. :yikes:.  Hey, maybe our robot will be able to drive over it again this year?? that would be exciting eh?




haha looks good guys keep up the high quality expected from LO
I spouted something sort of arrogant in a post a while back along the lines of, "If you do the algebra, you'll see that the total cost of the robot after billing out fabrication at a reasonable hourly rate will add up to several thousand dollars."

I guess I never really did any.

I suppose nobody else did either, or they would have called me on it.

Let's assume 30 unique parts for a major component, of varying complexity, averaging 2 hours each. Since they're making them in batches (at least groups of 4)... these hours could be minimized further. I assume that the average high school student entering a metalworkers union wouldn't be earning much past $20 an hour.

The algebra says that's only $1,200 folks. I wouldn't have gripes if they billed out high school kids at $15 an hour either.

Do we seriously not want these guys to compete with us this year?

If they can keep the total cost of the rest of their robot under $2300... it's fine by me. It's probably in their best interest to document their hours in some way so that it's clear.

But if they estimate their hours... are you seriously going to breathe down their necks?

Compassion has been lacking on my part, and I'll openly apologize if I've offended anyone. I was reminded of a quote.

*"If you judge people, you have no time to love them. And if you love people, you have no desire to judge them. Besides, there may come a time when we, too, will find ourselves more in need of love than judgment."* - Mother Teresa

umm yea, lol just so everyone knows, im just messin with the 302 kids, their my friends.  Figured i should post this just so i dont look like an idiot lol, because its obviously not their robot.  302 always makes high quality robots and i am looking forward to see this years in action.  Funny stuff though.
a hub reduction?? interesting.

Give the keys to your car to your best friend, and have them to take the old lady to the hospital right away, then head off to their appointment with your car.  Stay at the bus stop with the girl of your dreams.  She will be so impressed with your sensitivity to the plight of your friend and your community spirit by helping the old lady, she will immediately want to know more about you.  Get to know her while waiting for the bus, strike up a great conversation, go out on a date.  Let it lead to many others, and eventually to your proposal.  After a short engagement, you get married and have a fantastic honeymoon in Jamaica, and look forward to a wonderful life together.

Meanwhile, you find out the old lady at the side of the road was your spouse's mother.  She is tremendously wealthly.  She is so greatful to your best friend for driving her to the hospital that she immediately amends her will to leave her entire estate to your friend.  She never fully recovers from her injuries, and passes shortly thereafter.  Your best friend inherits the full estate, and immediately moves to the South Pacific with his new-found wealth.  Your wife is furious because she was completely left out of the will, and she blames you (after all, it was YOUR best friend that got all of HER money).  In retribution, she files for divorce, and claims half of your belongings.  Her lawyer is better than yours, and she cleans you out.  She then heads for the South Pacific, and spends the rest of her life with your former best friend and most of your money.  You now live in a small cardboard box on the side of the road.

Moral of the story: when driving, always concentrate on what is on the road ahead of you.  Things on the curbside are just distractions, and should be ignored - no good can come from any of them, no matter how friendly, attractive or needy they may appear.

I've had a few complaints (probably 5 or 6) about how I give out negatives reputations. I've also had one person who's thanked me for a negative reputation that I've given them. I've only had one comment about a positive reputation. I beleive that I give out about 2/3rds approve and 1/3 disapprove. I also leave comments on 90% of my comments, and 99.9% of my negatives

The way that I give out positive reputations is fairly nebulous, but the largest factor is how much reputatation you already have. I hold people with high reputations to a much higher standard if they want to get a positive reputation from me. The way I give out negative reputation is more defined.


- If something you post is wrong, and you provide no supporting information, you get a negative.
- If I have to think really hard to understand what you are saying, you get a negative (this mostly involves spelling and grammar).
- If you post with a negative attitude, you probably get a negative.
- If you post something in the blatantly wrong forum, or multi post a thread, you get a negative
- If post says nothing of value (and it's a technical type forum) you get a negative
- If you comment about a reputation you received publicly, you may get a negative (This thread is an exception, because it is designed to talk about reputation). Take it to PM or IM, and if something is really bad, let Brandon know, in private
- If you post a controversial topic, without it being the time or place to discuss it (or you being the correct person to post about it), then you probably get a negative.


Hopefully that clears up every negative I've given (and now I can point angry people to it, rather then explaining it to them when they are angry ;))

The most important thing to remember is that reputation levels out. There are many more people here who respect your opinion if it is well reasoned, then give out negative reputations if they disagree. If you all you see is a few random negative reputations, then don't worry about it. If you see a consistent trend, hopefully they left comments and you can think about what was said.

Hows that DeWalt chopsaw working for you?




Haven't had any problems but then again we've only had it for a couple months.



Also, any plans to shield that controller?  It looks rather exposed, and they will break when they take a good hit.




Yeah that is not the final electronics board and that whole area will be encased.

Hey, everyone.  I've heard a lot of people talking about how they left out the groove bit when putting together their double solenoids to slow the leaking, which is what our team did, but has anyone actually gotten it to stop leaking all together?  Also, is it legal to use old double solenoids?  Thanks very much!




Yes there is a rule that says you can use previous year's solenoids.


At first glance it seems that there are a lot of angry people in the FIRST community, but then upon a second reflection I realized these people are not angry… just ignorant, ignorance is a person’s worst enemy.  Those of you who are part of the large wave of antipathy in disagreement over the innovative ideas of Teams 60 and 254 need to again realize what FIRST is… a GAME


From what I've seen there are, in fact, some angry people. Just because a person is angry, does not make them ignorant and it is unfair to say such. No one has the right to tell people how they should or should not feel about something. You can disagree with them all you want, but no one has any right to tell someone not to be upset or angry about something.



Now I can tell you from past years experience that a group of students are not capable of doing every task on a piece of machinery such as a robot.  They should not be expected to experiment with welding or other similar tasks.  That would be careless and dangerous.  So I fully believe that 10% of the work was done outside of the team, as it should have been.


I know quite a few groups of students that are fully capable of "doing every task" on a robot and then some. It is not a requirement that a robot be welded, or that a student should be asked to weld anything. This whole thread is about experimenting with something new and different, correct?



I’m not sure how some of you call yourselves true FIRST participants if you honestly believe that teamwork and cooperation will ruin FIRST.  This all goes back to my first point, that ignorance is one’s worst enemy.  People oppose change because they are ignorant to the future.  I challenge all of you to learn more about these two landmark FIRST teams before you rudely call for their demise.


I don't think anyone has said that teamwork and cooperation will ruin FIRST. I think what people have been saying is, with this advanced level of cooperation, what stops the 1,000 teams in FIRST from building 1,000 identical robots? Why not just ship a set of instructions with the kit of parts each year? I have not seen anyone call for the demise of either of these teams. Some people are simply not happy with what they are doing.

If someone is unhappy, they're unhappy. What's done is done, and the situation isn't going to change. *shrug* What can you do?

The 120 psi is a hardware limit - the compressor has a relief valve.  Keeping it running will not charge it above 120psi unless you modify the compressor.




And the existing software code provides a redundant safety feature that provides two-fault tolerance. In the event that the relief valve should fail (not an unheard-of occurrence), the software limits the pressure output of the compressor to a safe level well below the burst pressure ratings of any of the pneumatic components provided in the FIRST kit. For that reason, the existing software that turns the compressor "Off" at 120psi must always take priority over all other functions.

(and yes, it also works the other way around - the relief valve acts as a backup for the software, in case you accidentally do something to mess with the software-commanded shut off)

just because Kingman is sponsored by FORD, i had to post this...


Imagine, if FORD and CHEVY collaborated to produce a car...now ford and chevy would have a great product, and succeed...

but then you would have tons and tons of FORD and CHEVY fans knocking at the CEO's door in the morning to dispute the decision to join the dark and light side(sorry, im a diehard FORD fan), and we would'nt have a fun little rivalry ;)...


just a humorous little analogy i thought that pertains to the subject at hand
Well as a freshman (I'm now a senior) the team leader/driver who was a senior at the time was in the same room as me in the hotels for both regionals and nats. Him and his senior friend developed what they liked to call "Freshman Privilege" in which they would do anything to torment us freshmen. I remember one such occurence was when i got locked out of my room and then only to have the door opened and have all this water dumped on me :(  not the greatest of times..soo.. i treat most of the freshman ok because of my traumatic experiences but by no means do they get away with anything, and yes they still have to do the menial jobs but dont all freshman?

this is so true andy keeps denying that devin has beaten him multiple times
for some reason after connection the motors to pwm 3 and 4 the robot just goes crazy it just sought of goes everywhere bashing everything. Anyone knows why?
this year I am the only member on our team with experience. It's hard to have to go through the whole brainstorming, design, and building process when you're the only one who has experience. It's a slow and painful process having to teach people how to use a mill or a lathe. especially having to show them again and again because they keep forgetting. There's also the other problem. A lot of them don't realise how much effort has to be put into this in order to succeed. I'm trying to get at least 50% attendance from everybody, but so far i'm the only one who has been there more than 50% of the time. so nobody knows what's happened to the robot designwise and what changes have been made. The Freshmen on our team were usually ignored on the earlier years until this year (since they're all freshmen except for me) so they were a little more involved and take a look at what they accomplished. http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictures.php?s=&action=single&picid=6259&direction=DESC&sort=date&perrow=4&trows=3&quiet=Verbose

That's truly an awesome paintjob from our freshmen.


moral of the story: don't judge a book by it's cover?


I remember one such occurence was when i got locked out of my room and then only to have the door opened and have all this water dumped on me :(


Awww ... that's horrible.

I know this thread was started in good fun and I'm glad to see it's stayed that way. I just wanted to throw this out there for the people who might take this thread a little more seiously than it was intended ...

When I was a freshman on 93, I wasn't treated lower than anyone else. True, I knew next to nothing when it came to electronics and mechanics, but that didn't mean I spent the year fetching aluminum magnets and metric crescent wrenches -- I spent the time learning from the people with more experience than me. I hope all the "lazy seniors" can teach the "stupid freshmen" a thing or two before their time on the team is up, rather than making the freshmen play 'fetch'.


> Keep in mind without Freshmen we couldn't have anyone else, whos gonna take over the robotics team!?
Yep. :)
Many on this forum have expressed concern for what has taken place this robotics season. A reason for this might be that is a previously unexplored avenue. Not that it is previously un thought of, just really never been explored to this extent before. Team 60 and team 254 are to outstanding teams in the FIRST community. As a rookie team 60 was my first encounter with a superb robot. ( 2001 ) They were one of the best built robots I had seen my life ( I saw this because they knocked us out in the quarterfinals of our division at nationals ). Team 60 has been one of the few robots I’ve looked forward to seeing every year. Our team has personally become stronger because of team 60. 1) because of their brilliance in performance making us desire to compete at their level, and 2) because of their outreach efforts to aid teams with things like their Marketing and promotional package and guidelines. 254 I have become more knowledgeable of during the past year or so. Hearing and watching them succeed and propel themselves into the national spotlight of FIRST has been an exciting process. They are among one of the teams I respect most for their effort to bring awareness of FIRST, science and technology.

I believe, like many others, that we all have great respect for what 60 and 254 have done for the FIRST community. We all greatly appreciate your efforts in this strive. I personally want to thank you for this.

I believe your thoughts and intentions in your special team development, bonding, and real life experience where pure and good. Call me blindly optimistic but I also believe that no one in this discussion believes that you did not work hard, or did not put forth good effort to create a superb robot.

No one is questioning your ethics, your desire to learn, your desire to teach, your desire to help, your desire to work, or your desire to share. We all understand that you would not have been elevated to the status that both your teams are at by not working hard.

It is the opinion of many however that the path taken to the extent it was taken is a bit shocking and a bit upsetting to some. There are certain rules and provisions made by FIRST and what you have done is touched on a grey area, and what seems to me has been somewhat of an unspoken boundary, a road that has not been traveled. It is easy to see how this may effect FIRST in the long run, does this kind of partnership continue to happen, or does it not.. If it were to continue, where might it end? Again blind optimism has it that it is my belief these questions do not arise because people want you out of competition, but more in questions of fairness within guidelines of the rules.

Even in FIRST’s statement there can be great things accomplished where it is still illegal. In years of old it may have been illegal to proclaim the catholic church wrong, punishable by death, but it didn’t stop those old famous guys to say “ Hey maybe Earth goes around the sun “ or “ Maybe the earth isn’t flat but rounded. “ So what I’m saying is it might end up being an ok thing, however we still must be careful.

To those who have stated “ If this were 2 rookie teams would anyone have looked twice upon it, “ I say maybe, most likely they would have been talked to by older veteran teams but it would not have received the hipe. However with as much respect as your teams command comes great responsibility and scrutiny. You will always be in the spotlight as long as you are on top. You may not have asked to be put there, but when you do things as amazing as your teams, you automatically get put their like it or not. Its just the nature of things, with great Status comes great responsibility. When you make any stance on a grey area you’ll find those who support your stance and those who do not. Especially if some of the members feel “ shafted, “ or “ cheated. “

I still feel some questions are unanswered, but I do not feel it necessary to post them again. I also believe most all questions will be answered if and when FIRST releases a statement.

I want to close by thanking Team 60 and Team 254 for all they have done for the FIRST community, and the noticeable amount of work that they put forth this year in trying to elevate their level of competition. Tho I still might disagree with the way they went about this style of collaboration, I still do not believe that they had the wrong intentions. It is still my hope that FIRST does not all together venture down this path, but I will stand behind FIRST’s decision and adjust accordingly, even if I might disagree.

Thank you again 60 and 254 for all you’ve done and continue to do.

Dan
oh no why would they make that rule. last year we were aloud to do it.


sometimes i get the feeling that the guys at FIRST like to just make up rules.
i.e. the sound rule
Well right now I've been working a lot, 12 hours a day on weekends and around 7 to 8 on weekdays due to the fact that I live here at school (its a residential boarding school).  I've actually considered the thought of moving into the lab as I spend more time there than I do in my dorm or anywhere else on campus..........I was even in the lab during the Valentines dance on Saturday night......needless to say some people werent to happy with me after that.
Ok you have my attention...

afrobot? :p

Keep in mind without Freshmen we couldn't have anyone else, whos gonna take over the robotics team!?



Yes I know this whole thread was started as fun but heres a little food for thought...
I know that freshman on my team are treated now as equals, all people on 250 are treated as equals and that is how we do things.  I dont know how other teams do things but age and grade is no different then gender and race which has no effect to our team.  Many of you should take a lil more time to think of what you post on here because these forums are read by many FIRST staff and what you say reflects upon your whole team.

P.S.~ werent we all freshman at a time and arent freshman the people who are taking over our teams as we graduate?


If another robot runs  into it, will the arm slide off the bar?



i hope no...cause we made the arm to be resistan enough to stay in the bar in the case of a bot come and hit it.  :D
2 drills = drive
um.... 1, 2, 3, 4 cylinders,
i want a keyang motor(1lbs) on for another application which should weigh a total of maybe 3lbs at the most if we have 3lbs to spare....
and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of bungee. or maybe a heavy duty spring.
They probably archived them to save space, they are still there, they just moved them to make room. Monday night they had no more space left, you'll notice all forms posted before Monday are the ones gone.
are your motor polarities correct? if one were backwards, the robot would turn when it thinks it's going forward, and go forward or back when it thinks it's turning... this would cause some really strange behavior.
You can just leave lots of slack.  If you have a cyclinder on an arm put an air tank up there and connect with loose tubing.

goto statements are BAD. Use a do-while or something. :P
its to use instead of the paddles that the human players were going to be provided  :eek:


where did you get the rollers?




i bet they cut some delrin (sp?) down to size.. delrin, mmm, i love that stuff- so easy to lathe and so efficient
I never saw any such control thing in the code - where is it?  And doesn't this require that the compressor and switch be wired up in a very specific way?  I fail to see how this works...


Have you asked on the Q&A if you can change margins/font?





No.

I took it to mean I couldn't change their font or their form, but I could use any font in my answers as long as it's not less than 10.
You should be running the compressor forward - it probably was not working right, or something like that.
For 'teasing' hair.. not bot related.
I believe the 883s are good for any drill motors that aren't last year's or this year's, so you should be fine...
Can we please get some serious imput (though I do like my fun and games (see above posting))?

> Well it turns like you wouldn't believe and it seems to work great!

Good!
I'm glad someone has had good sucess with casters.
Make sure you note your designs for future years. It will come in handy.
Hey hey... a lot like our design. We have our motors on the same axis as the wheels, and our wheels are hollow so the gear reduction (cim: 1:11, drill: 1:41) actually fits within the wheel. Plus it is swivel drive. But it looks very cool and seems to be a very good way to get up the stairs. Too bad we use 6" wheels, we cant do a thing about the stairs.
Sorry for the double post, but I have some updates
Well, first off we weighed in at 91 lbs w/o our battery. The goal hooks (not pictured) were installed at the time of weighing as well as 90% of our plow, and everything for the arm pictured thus far.
So, predicted weight 105 w/ battery, leaving us roughly 25 lbs for our arm.
Not too shabby.
Also, I'm hoping to upload some links to video clips within the next day or two of us in action. I hope to edit this post to do so, so keep checking back every now and then.
Later!
You're going to "comb" the field clean?
It looks like you didn't use your multi-drive system? any particular reason?
Well I put other in the vote box.
Basically this year we're using a table-driven dead reckoning auto mode.
We have an autonomous function selection panel, a switch panel of 10 switcehs, each to perform a single funtion. For example, one switch might be "grab goal" or "uncap goal" or "drive back to driver station" and so forth.
At the init of auto mode, a table is set up bild from all the smaller functions tables, and the autonomous mode is executed step by step.
That means you probably won't see us doing the same thing twice.
See you at competition!

Hmm.  OUr yougest member is by far our most porductive.  He's in seventh grade.  And as for freshman, they make up more than half the team, and get treated the same as everyone else.

And well last year on 226 we seemed to have an abundance of freshman (many of whom were also in band, as I was, so I saw them every morning also) and my standard greeting was "Morning Freshman."  It wasn't mean though, it was just their nickname.  It did however backfire this year (I am now a college freshman) and when I saw some of last years freshman for the first time this year and said hello with my usuall greeting, as I had done for the past year,  except the reply I got was "Who are you to be talking, FRESHMAN."  OH Well.  I still slip up and call them freshman sometimes.  They roll their eyes at me.

We did joke about the freshman being well, lower, but when it came to design, building, the really important stuff everyone is pretty much equal.  Another Senior, A freshman, and I went to get lunch for the team on saturday, and while at Arby's we forgot the ketchup.  We stopped at the McDonald's on the way back and made the freshman go in and ask for ketchup.  She went in and told them "I'm the freshman and the seniors made me come get ketchup," and they gave her not only ketchup but two free pies. :yikes:

We have a hard-working 6th grader and 7th grader.

LOL about McDonalds!
I treat people by there maturity, dedication and skill level.  I feel that if you are mature and dedicated, you can gain skillz in the shop. I feel that if you are mature and have skill, you will naturally be dedicated. If you aren't mature, then go work on your project in a corner..(I'm not always mature). I will always crack freshman jokes...but the freshman know that if they work hard they have my respect.

There is a rather annoying freshman on our team and she always gets picked on. Today someone hid her project when she wasnt looking, and she over reacted so the teacher told us to find the missing part in 5 min or we are leaving.  We all scrambled around our huge messy shop looking for it, and finally found it.  Nobody admitted to doing it and i feel it is probable that she hid it so that she could get the attn. Who knows who cares?

That is why i feel that maturity is the most important factor.  Whatever
Team 254 wishes to thank everyone for their comments in regards to our collaboration with Team 60. Even though we made this venture with the best intensions in mind (our students), it seems that some have issue with our choices. We have open minds and have noted each and every recommendation/concern.

Our teams (60 and 254) encourage, and are interested in, all thoughts about the “concept” of collaboration, and felt it would be a great concept for FIRST teams to analyze more this season. Most have given respectful, open minded, and well thought out opinions on both sides of the discussion – some love how we are working together, some are troubled by it and fear “possible” ramifications down the road, and many are somewhere in between. We have planned all along to document our experiment, to share the positive aspects and difficult aspects with the entire FIRST community at the conclusion of the season, and look forward to continued input from our many friends in the FIRST community.

When looking at some posts of those assigned the “con” side of the proposed “debate” – we realize that many statements have been for neither discussion nor debate, rather they have been statements of assumption, attack and accusation that unfairly slander our teams. As all our actions and intentions have been within the exiting FIRST rules, it troubles us that these people have used words like “cheat”, “broken rules”, and have implied our teams have “not been straight” about our goals. This is not only hurtful to us mentors, but more importantly to our students. Statements like these show very little knowledge of our teams, are unfounded, unfair, and ungracious – and clearly show us that continuing a “debate” would mean we would either need to lower ourselves to that level or defend ourselves against baseless and incorrect claims. As we have already lost valuable time this week, and there is only one week left before the ship date, we feel it’s in the best interest of all to dedicate their time and effort to their team members and the challenges in front of them.  As FIRST will have the final word on this, I don't see any advantage of participating in this debate.  We look forward to FIRST's guidance and will comply with their ruling.

What makes this thread even more intriguing, is that all of it is speculation at this point, as neither of our robots have even worked or competed yet. We would hope people and teams would reserve judgment until they see what may or may not result from our collaboration. It appears that FIRST may have provided all of us with one of the best games yet, and the upcoming season should be fun and exciting for all. As usual, we look forward to seeing and working with all of you at any events we attend. Best of luck to every team in the 2004 season – we wish you all a great experience.


are all your spikes backwords or just one?  you might have the relay out ribon on backwords




All spikes run backwards (Red light when relay forward bit is set).  Relay 5 was just the one I tested beacuse it is my compressor and the easiest to test.  I needed to comfirm that the red LED on on these new spkies was correct and the compressor was running on -12V (I should have checked that before posting anything but that was my mistake).  The single solenoid I was previously talking about is now wired correctly to M+ and external ground.  It runs perfectly by setting relay3_fwd=1 in my corrected (ifi_aliases.h) code.

And as I prevoiusly stated

> The relay output cable was connected correctly.

and that applies to all the 3-pins cables.  Unlike before, I have now check and double checked every part of the system (program, electrical, pnematics).  Before I was operating with only the knowledge of the program (I am in charge of that) and the wiring directions I gave the electrical team.
Will the scale be available for use on Saturday?
HAAS Has a really good manual on it and a quick reference card.  Also, there is CNC Machining magazine which is really cool.  If you have any basic questions on CNC operation or programming, let me know and I'll try to help.
I'm going!

EDIT: Forgot to add that we will have about 9 students (our whole team), about four college mentors, a couple of adult mentors, and a couple parents.

Hi all, just thought I'd throw in my two cents.  First of all our team (368) is taking a year off (everyone is burnt out), so unfortunately we won't be able to join in on all the fun.

Over the past two years we have been removing our pinion gears using an arbor press which has been a real pain as those gears are on pretty tight and have more than once bent our pinion removing fixture.

While rumaging through my tool box the other day, I came across a Craftsman (sears) nut splitter and all of a sudden it occured to me that this might be the easiest (destructive) way to remove it.  Since I had a broken bosch motor from last year (brush assembly broke off, I decided to try the nut splitter on the pinion gear to see how it would work.  After carefully aligning it on the pinion gear, I grabed the nutsplitter with a wrench so as not to put any pressure on the shaft of the motor and used another small wrench on the screw that forces the nut, or in this case the pinion gear into the anvil.  In two seconds, I heard a little cracking sound.  The pinion gear is hardened and brittle and with very little pressure at all, the nut splitter put a hairline crack in the pinion gear and it basically just slid off the shaft without damaging the shaft.  Basically the anvil gets wedged between the teeth of the pinion and causes the teeth to split apart (the anvil fits between the teeth but does not bottom out) as you apply pressure to the screw.

A nutsplitter from Sears is about $15.00 or so and definitely is the quickest and easiest way I found to remove a pinion gear off of the bosch motor.  Only a little pressure is required and but you may have to reset the nutsplitter on the pinion gear as the screw may break a few of the teeth off first.

I wish I had figured this out two years ago which would have saved us a lot of time.  If anyone has an old damaged bosch, try it for themselves.  It works great.  Just remember to go slow and easy on the screw as it doesn't take much effort.

Again, this method will work as long as you don't mind destroying the pinion gear.  Lastly, I only tried this on last years bosch motor so it might not work that well on the fp motor which has a much larger pinion gear.

If anyone tries this, let me know how it worked for you.

Oh well, have fun, wish we could be compete with you all as we never did make a robot that could pull itself up on a bar.

Sides of the frame. :)
When you guys talk about freshmen, do you mean 9th graders or first year members?  Our team doesn't care at all about age.  However, we usually do care about years on the team.  I can't stand it when new people come in and act like they know everything.  We treat productive freshmen the same way as everyone else.  As for excesively ambitous new people, we have one rule:what happens in the hotel, stays in the hotel... ;)
I took it to mean that you are limited to using the space provided on the form as it is being used as a cover sheet for your submission.  So it's one page in length.  Font = size 10 or greater.
The fact that this is somehow related to FIRST only proves that hair care products are the center of the universe.
Unfortunally, our team isn't behind so we only meet on weekdays from 3 to 6.  I wish they would let us work later. :(
Section 2 of the manual includes a link to a form which I can't seem to call up when I paste into my browser address bar:
2.1 OVERVIEW
This section provides teams with necessary information for contacting FIRST staff, using the FIRST logo, and other information regarding such topics as the Yearbook Page.
A form for all of your team information can be found at
http://www.usfirst.org/2004comp/yourteaminfoform.pdf

Does anyone know where I can get this form, which I am assuming is to help us compile our Yearbook information?
we havent felt the pressure yet, for an unknown reason. so we meet 2 hours (5:30-7:30) a night a 4 (10-2) hours on saturday. i hate going home when theres more work to do tho, i would stay till 10 if they let me  :(
I would like to confirm that the the alias's are backward. Relay fwd should be green light, ours was red.

My question is has IFI released a default program that is correct?
uhh...nice, I like the folding into a box part...only one question .... why did you choose to put the right-handed joystick that came in the kit this year in the operator's left hand?


I have tried to get the servo working. i read the forums, and i see that they only run off the backup battery. is this true?




Yes,
A little gift from Innovation FIRST is that the servo power is only from the backup battery (7.2 volts)  If you are going to tuse servo make sure you have some way to check the battery and keep it charged.


Not to sound like a broken record, but do not cut away the pinion if you want to keep the motor.




Guys,
For those of you who do not know Paul, he is one of the best mechanical guys around.  If he says something about motors, believe it.  He won't steer you wrong.  I would trust him with my robot.

Jim,
To what in the picture are you referring?  The cable trough, tubing, what?  The cable trough I have seen in McMaster Carr.  You have to be dilligent as you need to know what "they" call it before you can look it up in their catalog.  I may be labelled raceway, or cable protector, or flexible cable guide.  Basically anything.
Jim,
The weight issue only will be invoked if you have two attachmaents and you want to qualify both of them but only use on at a time.  Both plus the robot must be under 130.  (I don't think this rule is very good BTW)  You will have plenty of time at the regional to make up your mind, so ship both.
Very nice.  I must ask though, what is that pneumatics for on the left module?


for some reason after connection the motors to pwm 3 and 4 the robot just goes crazy it just sought of goes everywhere bashing everything. Anyone knows why?


I'd put it up on blocks and check the status of the IR sensor tracking.
Call the tracker alone without the navigate and print out the tracker status:
Tracker_Data[LEFT].Status, Tracker_Data[RIGHT].Status

Also observe how the servos behave.
Does it hold on the beacon or look all over the room?

After you're sure the tracker/beacon combo are working correctly, then move on to debugging the navigator code.


I'm almost done with the animation....I know it's pretty fast to be done...But thats not the point.  I had rendered everything in max in mov format and mpeg4   compression...Then i dl'd Premiere Pro Trial and loaded everything in with the slate and all. Then i rendered it again, and absolutly according to the specs...720*480, DV-NTSC, 29.97fps and .mov, so why is it that the file size is 261mB... Especially when they said to keep the file size **well** under 250 megs.




Here we go again. 2 years ago autodesk gave codec requrements that produced files that wont fit on a CD. (of course they changed it in team update). Similar things now....

Try emailing Autodesk?
We can break things down into to larger categories, analog and digital.  There are certain components on the robot that are one or the other.  Basically, an analog signal is going to be anything from 0-254 giving a variable output.  This is what you want to use on anything relating to a drive motor or in general any motor whose value needs to change.  Then we have components that are digital.  Now, digital components are either on or off.

1)You have this speed controllers (black box thing with a fan on top of it)-
Now what this does is offer an analog signal to your component in order to  get it moving at a variable speed.  Case and point, you want to use this on a drive motor(s) in order to get varying speed.

2) You hvae a spike (the smaller unit with four "prongs" sticking out of it)-
This is offers the digital signal to devices that run off of this.  This means that it is outputting either a 0 or 1 either on or off.  So, you would hook this up to a pneumatic which would give the initial on/off signal.

Now essentially everything you have will go through the breaker panel.  This is to protect your electronic devices.  Why?  Well, if for some reason a certain device begins to pull more current (amperage) than it can handle, the fuse/breaker will "blow" and will protect the device from burning up.  Now here, we use the auto-resetting breakers (black with two thick prongs coming out the bottom).  These are much better than a regular fuse.  With a fuse, too many amps are being pulled and the metal inside breaks and no more electricity is sent through, however, that device will no longer work.  Then we have the auto reset breakers which, if too much current is pulled, will "trip" or cut the electricity going to the device and then a few seconds later, will re-allow electricity to flow, so long as that amperage is not being pulled.
Drop me a message on here and I will email/send you the pdf file of the powerpoint presentation I used during the preseason with our students.  It discusses many analog and digital sensors, as well as PWM's, victors, spikes, the RC/OI etc.

If you have any other questions....feel free to post them.
hmmmm.....

this is a shot in the dark, last year we rendered un-compressed frames in Max.  Then we went in an compressed them in premiere using the codec specifications we did last year. I think that you are running into problems b/c it has to compress twice.  Have you rendered to still shots from max?  If you do that output to a tiff (best quality).  That is the only possible thing that I think could help you.

if u have to email autodesk put EMERGENCY in the title.  They usually respond a little faster.  Otherwise it will take 3-5 weeks to get a straight answer.
I drive a 1996 Maroon/silver S-10 w/ LS trim package and a 5-speed...don't see that too often. The 5spd is the only thing that makes up for the lack of power that the 2.2L 4cyl vortec puts out. One thing that I have learned from driving this car...i never ever ever ever ever want to own a car with an automatic transmission...ever. For some reason my parents are really over-protective about their cars...so i am never allowed to drive them to school, but most other places are fine...2003 maroon TrailBlazerEXT 5.3L Vortec...2003 blue Pontiac Vibe 1.8L Toyota engine...an incredible engine...a lot better than my 2.2L vortec...I only wish that it was the GT (180hp 1.8L, 6-speed manual, 4 wheel disc brakes, 4 wheel independent suspension...) but since my mom can't drive a stick, that was out of the question. :(


So if our compressor was working right before this, do we dare correct the problem and reverse the polarity?





There are two reasons why the manufacturer of the compressor would like the polarity observed for the compressor motor.

A) The fan in the motor was designed to move the most air with the least noise/power when turned in one direction only(axial fans).  That direction will be when you observe the correct polarity.  (result- motor will run cooler and longer)

B) Almost all series wound DC/AC universal motors or PM DC motors have the commutator shifted with respect to the main magnetic field to minimize commutation arcing.  So they are most efficient when turning in the direction of the default polarity( e.g. the recommended polarity).  This is the reason why the motor will not produce the same rpm/power in either direction.  (Also, a radial fan operates equally well in either direction, an axial fan (like the compressor has, does not.)  When such a motor is reversed, the commutation can be seen to arc more than the forward case, this arcing will cause the brushes and commutator life to be reduced, the commutator temperature to rise.  Further, the arcing represents energy lost and hurts the overall efficiency of the motor.  (Efficiency is what you get/what you pay for...)

Motors can be designed to work the same in either direction, but at an overall loss in efficiency.

So, bottom line:  wire the compressor backwards will work, but will run hotter, use more power and produce less work, and will have a shorter life than normal.
I just did some test renders, and 250mb seems a little high. I did moderately complex scene (color-distribution wise) and rendered 900 frame sequence - so far its been 115, and 105mb  Is it premiere thats spitting out these huge files? or did max do same thing?
As a team we meet-
M-Th : 6-9pm
F      : technically the meeting is 6-9 but some HS students usually stay from afterschool around 3ish and college advisors often get in right after classes are over for the day.
Sat   : 10am - 4pm is the standard meeting and if more work has to be done 6pm - whenever we get kicked out (sometimes around midnight).
Sun  : 1pm - 4 pm
We have been working really hard and long and things are coming together very well!
Time is divided into school and non-school sections.  Here are our respective schedules at the shop.

School - 3:30PM to ~12:00AM
Non-school - 9:00AM to ~12:00AM

As it gets nearer to the deadline, like next week, we may end up skipping school and/or working past 12.
We also got distace sensors for our robot, and i have been trying to find out if they are allowed at competition. They are Sharp GP2D12 . I cannot find the opperating frequency--i know that the IR light is ~800 nm as opposed to FIRST's ~900nm (i think), but i dont think that this will be enough of a difference to avoid interference.  Anyone have these/played with these/found them to be a problem/etc?
Last year, our two freshmen were by far some of the best workers we had.  One of them was probably there more than I was :p   In my mind, it's all about how much they want to learn and get involved.  If a freshman (or any new member) wants to just stand around and do nothing, then he or she can spend the six weeks playing fetch and filing corners on the frame.  If, on the other hand, they want to get involved, I'm happy to teach them.  The freshman I mentioned above is now the electrical team leader, as well as the overall project manager because of her involvement last year.

So, the moral of the story is, don't just beat up on your freshmen.  They can be a valuable asset if they're motivated and you help them get involved.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with the occasional search for an adjustable Allen wrench :p
I see, because I posted ours on Sunday as well. By the way, what is autodesk's support email?
So was this a design from Hildebrandt?  I know he'd always been thinking about stuff like that.


Very nice.  I must ask though, what is that pneumatics for on the left module?




i could be wrong, but i think they nu-matic was just sitting on the table when they took the picture.  it doesn't look like it's attached to anything.
I just went back to streamline and I don't think it's much of a threat anymore. I think autodesk is just looking at the forms and creating folders for all of the teams who are submitting an animation. For some reason though, I don't see a folder for my team. Not even in the rookies section for final submissions.

The freshman I mentioned above is now the electrical team leader, as well as the overall project manager because of her involvement last year.

So, the moral of the story is, don't just beat up on your freshmen.  They can be a valuable asset if they're motivated and you help them get involved.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with the occasional search for an adjustable Allen wrench :p




As a freshman, I never spoke up that much, so I was pushed aside. Some kids leared motors, others building and pnumatics. I learned non of those skills. Instead, I focused my attention on scouting and stratagey, that's something I really liked. I had fun and now I'm catching up on my building skills. For us, we need more frosh. Next year, I'm counting only 2 seniors, 5 juniors, and NO SOPHMORES AND FRESHMAN. That's right, we're screwed over! :ahh:

As for getting things that arn't there, I always send people out to go get some elbow grease and headlight fluid.


uhh...nice, I like the folding into a box part...only one question .... why did you choose to put the right-handed joystick that came in the kit this year in the operator's left hand?




The new kit joystick is the copilot joystick, which will fit in his/her right hand.  The copilot's left hand will operate the button box.  The pilot has control of the two old-school joysticks on the right.

How's the band going?  Probably on hold (at least for you) while you guys build your latest masterpiece.

Best of luck this year.
Anyone have any comments about the actual content of the site?


We also got distace sensors for our robot, and i have been trying to find out if they are allowed at competition. They are Sharp GP2D12 . I cannot find the opperating frequency--i know that the IR light is ~800 nm as opposed to FIRST's ~900nm (i think), but i dont think that this will be enough of a difference to avoid interference. Anyone have these/played with these/found them to be a problem/etc?


We have these and shelved them when the IR beacon/tracking was introduced at kick-off. Even the appearance of interference would be troublesome.
According to the spec sheet:
- The GP2D12 is at 850 +- 70, so the wavelength with +/- error (780 to 920nm) does overlap the peak 940nm+/- wavelength of the IR beacon LEDs.
- the IR signal generated is at a 20-38Hz rate about 1/3 the 100Hz rate of the beacon.

I'd be worried mostly about clutter obscuring the beacon waveform for other players. It won't cause another robot to home in on you or anything like that, but it can make the beacon signal harder to pick out of the IR clutter. Even though the beacon is BLASTing the IR sensor won't differentiate between stronger and weaker IR. It's just on or off.

You might want to substitute ultrasonic range finders instead.

--edit-- If you decide to use them I would suggest a little experimentation. The IR interference goes both ways. You'll want to test your range finder in the presence of the beacon. Bathing it in IR may trigger it to think there's always an object in front of it.
I've never actually gotten into manga/comics. The whole style that they do them in is just rather annoying to me. I'd rather sit down with a good book. I'm not saying that comics are horrible, it's just that they just aren't for me. :(
very nice...we might try doing swerve drive next year...check out the sexy robot :P
Very Nice Job, looks like they will work great
Your Yearbook Page is a link on your TIMS (team info management system) not in the manual. This in the information that needs to be entered.  Maybe I am misinterpreting your question?Ask again if I am.  The link you posted didn't work for me.
FYI:  Little history and explanation of the harmonic drive. (Link)](http://www.berton.com.sg/bapl/hds/mechanism.shtml)

Did you guys manufacture that or is it off the shelf?  Either way I think it's very cool.  Can't wait to get a closer look.
I asked IFI this two years ago.

'12V is the max. I know that radio Shack carries a 9.6V battery pack that we
use here and at competitions. You will have to modify the connector to fit
the OI. This battery pack is like a 4-pack of AA's. Radio Shack also carries
a charger for this pack. The connector is a 2.1mm X 5.5mm.'

Courtesy of Tom Watson!

I bought a 1500maH battery pack and connector so we could run the robot in a parade.

It seems like you're a little unclear on the meaning of the power diagram.  The big power diagram shows all the pure power connections of the robot.  These are large gauge wires that transmit electricity from the battery to the motors.

Seperate but related, are the control connections.  Victor 883s have 3 wire PWM cables connected to them that you connect to PWM headers (pins) on the robot RC.  This is how the RC gets instructions to the Victor to control the speed of the motor.  Spikes work similarly, but go to a seperate set of headers.

The best way to find out about this is to go to www.innovationfirst.com and look at all their white papers and documentation about victors and spikes.
we have one senior, 2 juniors, 17 sophomores, and 3 freshman.. yeah kinda weird isnt it. Oh yeah.. abbout my above post. Theres only 1 freshman on the team who deserves to play fetch. This is becuase he has broken hafl our parts and never stops talking about counter strike. I actually took one of the other freshman on as a "padawan", making him follow me everywhere and teaching him what different things are and how to use different machines.
A.K.A. Frame rails


a form which I can't seem to call up Does anyone know where I can get this form, which I am assuming is to help us compile our Yearbook information?




I've never seen that form, that link doesn't work for me, I searched usfirst.org and didn't find it, you could just print the TIMS Yearbook page to have a hard copy to work from. It also allows you to update and correct the yearbook page up to the due date IMO


WHAT ARE THOSE TIRES? Please share, even if it's only in a PM.  I have got to know what they are.  Thanks.



The material used is PU (Poliuretane), I guess that´s the word in english. It´s very hard, but it sticks to all surfaces when pressed.
If there any other doubt, please post  ;)
kinda looks like a weapon from UT
Well guys with a week left here we are.  Tell us what you think.
You guys forgot "Here, File"  But yea being a freshman it is all about paying your dues and ensuring you know what you are doing. I put my heart into all the minial jobs that I had to do and people took notice. I ended up being the first (and only) freshman to attend the practice of regionals  and I was one of only 2 sophmores to go to it last year. Yea it can be annoying work some times but if you do it and not complain you are that much higher up than the others. Plus as a thank you note the senior on the very last match of our Zone Zeal competitiion allowed me to be the H.P. and be on the main stage outside of Epcot!
you should have rendered the original file out of max in the highest possible setting. I'm not sure cuz i havent used max... but it would probably be an uncompressed DV standard AVI. Then you could compress it in premiere (theres a tool in it that will size it automatically, all you have to do is give it guidelines such as frame size, and final size(under 250 mb's)) Trying to compress a compression just isnt going to work. Heres an example. Take a wav file of a song and compress it to mp3. Add this to a zip archive. Then take that original wav and do the same. You will see the pecentage each drops down is quite different. (I know this isnt what you are looking for, but it is just an example)

Nah, hildebrandt didnt design it.

We manufactured it ourselves. it took lots and lots of man hours... we only broke 2 CNC mills though... we made 7 of them. Our design is based on the "if we shove this piece into this piece, it will work!" method, and it works really well. It makes a cool humming noise, too!
what exactly are the gripper arms in the front for?
Those arms are for autonomous to knock off the 10pt ball
ahh i keep forgetting about that little 10 point monster. You seem to be one of the few teams so far that have posted pics on CD that are going for it. Good Job! Without teams like your teams like mine would be in lots of trouble.... *whatever that means*
Does anyone know where I can get this form, which I am assuming is to help us compile our Yearbook information?

As Cheryl has said, I think the most efficient way to do the YB entry is
1. print out form from your TIMS. Then
2. fill out the numbers
3. write short blurbs in Word or whatever to answer each of the questions.  Save these answers for the future.  You've just defined a lot about your team.  Hint:Everyone on your team needs to know these answers.  These are like the "headlines" about your team.
4.Edit out all extra words. Then take out even more since you will still have too many.  If you have more for one question make sure you have a lot less in another.Save this version too.
5. cut and paste this into form.
6. enter numbers and other stuff.
7. You can then go in and edit on the TIMS up until the due date. Make sure you print out a copy for your files since this info disappears after the due date.
8. As FIRST keeps warning, don't wait until the last minute. It takes longer than you think.
Thanks for all the wonderful comments.

To confirm you suspicions, yes we do have the "nerve to swerve" this year.  Our gearboxes are powered by the Fisher Price and Drill motors, with Globe handling the steering.

Shifting Swerve Drive?  The idea was talked about, but in the end we felt we wouldn't have the weight for it.  Our gearbox mastermind, Ian Mackenzie may want to elaborate on this.

In regards to the pneumatic cylinder on the table, you are correct in that it was just lying on the table at the time of the picture.  But, that is not to say we aren't using pneumatics on our drive system...  You'll have to wait until the next teaser to see those.

Or, you could look very carefully at the following video clips.  This is footage of our robot driving for the first time.

yeah thanks we were thinking about forgeting about the 10pt ball too but we decided against it.  We intended to keep it simple.  That plan worked very well last year.  Fast in high, powerful in low, and does what we want every time.
This is how I wired them up for the FriarBot:

-The brown lead has to pull +12v through a breaker. (dont use the +5 output from the digital i/o ports, its not enough)

-The blue lead has to go to the ground pin on a digital i/o port.

-Either the black or white lead has to go to the signal pin on that io port.    Only use either the black or white. The white lead is for "sourcing output" - the white lead will go high when the sensor "sees" the line. The black lead is for "sinking output" it will go low when the sensor "sees" the line.

-I used sinking output for our design, but i dont think that it really matters. Just remember that the sourcing output will register a logic 1 in the code, and the sinking registers a logic 0.

See this page for schematics http://www2.usfirst.org/2003comp/Specs/bannersensors.pdf

Also, check out our team site at www.friarbot.com
haha that is soo classic...we have about 6 freshman, we never let them live it down but at the beginning of the season we were driving our old robot and 3 of them walked in and just sat their mouth opens in awe...one of them finally said so we get to build one of them huh!? it wus classic they were sooo amazed!
Compressing a compression, I think, has different issues than are being discussed here.  I can't see doing a lossy compression twice as actually increasing file size by a significant amount.  However, doing lossy compression twice will definitely adversely affect the quality of the video.

So basically, I agree with most here.  Render the animation as an uncompressed AVI, or a series of lossless compressed TIFs, then dump that into Premiere, edit what you want, and compress it from there.  Premiere should give you enough options to fiddle with the compression quality and get it down to size.  I wouldn't let premiere actually resize the video to get it to size though.  Aside from the video resolution formatting requirements, resizing the video will, again, mess with the quality.  If it absolutely has to be resized, render it again if you have time.

Also note, the plus about rendering to a series of TIFs is that you can grab a load of your teammates spare computers, network them, and do a network render over a weekend.

how are you guys gona turn with those wheels?
are tracks going to be mounted on that?


werent we all freshman at a time?




not everyone .. i went from grade eight to grade 10 .. but still completed all the work for all my grade 9 courses ... try that one on ...

as to treating freshmen .. we have one on our team and we treat him the same .. sure i call him a freshman some of the time ... but its all jokes and he knows it ...

and going to find non-existant tools ??  making people (not just freshman) find something non-existant (not just tools) is common within the team .... my engineer told me (a junior) yesterday to find a left-handed screwdriver .. but then again he was calling a hammer a hacksaw and a nut a screw ... and one time he left us alone to have the motors hooked up by the time he got back ... when we saw him coming back we werent done yet so i led him around the building to find a monkey .. hahaha .. now thats a joke between the team ....


Thanks for all the wonderful comments.




Karthik,
Looks awesome.
Can't wait to see it in Long Island!

John
I'm insulted. I'm *way* smarter than anyone else on our team and I'm a freshmen. ;)
Very clever and compact gearbox & swerve design.

Nicely done.

Joe J.

P.S. I have just watched the videos. Looks even better. One think I know from experience is that the control software and the operator interface are key parts of getting the most out of machines with the nerve to swerve. I know these were just baby pictures, but it seems to me that you have a lot of work to do in both areas.

This is not a criticism, but just a heads up while there is still time to improve -- we were one of the early adopters of swerve and I have spent 10 all nighters (at least) trying to get the robot to behave.

One consequence of not getting it right is that the drivers tend to get into the "blame the machine" mode where whenever the robot is not working, it is the software's fault -- sometimes this is actually the case, but a lot of the time it was operator error and the operator did not get better because they did not look to themselves as the source of the problem. Think about it.

Finally, please don't take this as a criticism. I like your design quite a lot. You have chosen a difficult path -- I solute you. JJ
I realized not all the parts int he kit had come so I would do it in 6 weeks and TWO days, but low and behold...
When I was one last year, I came at the perfect time - I was the only one who had a clue as to how to program the darn thing.  I learned PBASIC in a grand total of a few hours, and earned some respect very quickly like that :)
feeder
wow guys.  I think you will be disapointed when you see our shop.  In fact we just put chairs and stuff in the way to pratice.


shaun
Good job Team 115! This is a great example of what FIRST should mean to all teams. Hearing this kind of thing just lifts my spirits, especially a week away from Ship Date, when there seems to be a lot to worry about.

I hope both 115 and 1043 do well with their robots!

were all the robots parts waterjetted? they look too pretty to be milled. and i love the whole powdercoating, thats one sexy bot.
Waht are those little things underneath your yellow ball roller, are those also to assist with moving the  balls or do they have an entirly different function? But overall it looks nice and I wish you guys the best of luck
We are doing something like line following/ infered lighting if we decide to go for the 10 pt. but if we are going for the goal we are set up for Dead reackonign I believe
Looks very good.  I've trying to convince my team to get those ten point ball but I don't have much influence.  Good luck in Houston.  I'll hopefully be watching a webcast.  I hope to get a picture of 1108 up here soon.  But since they are being stingy with pictures, I will post as soon as they put it on the [website](http://www.pantherrobotics.com).
We aren't using infra-red until we are within feet of the beacon.


are tracks going to be mounted on that?




Nothing else makes sense, at least not without knowing more about their 'bot.

A question, though.

That looks like its at least a half-inch thick! how heavy is it?
it looks like thats a caster so when they go up the stairs/platform they dont bottom out
10 motors
6 pneumatic cylinders

2 drills 2 FP's for the drive train

1 van door 2 globes for the arm

1 chip for the ball sucker

2 servos for the ball thwacker (highly technical terms we use here)

pneumatics
1 for the ball sucker
1 for the goal grabber/platform climber
1 for the claw
2 for gear shifting
1 for engaging the winch


lots and lots of powered functions on this years bot.


We're not officialy competing because we couldn't get our registration fee, but we decided to build a robot for practice, because we plan to compete in '05.  Well actually, It's not just for practice, but we haven't released other plans for it yet, because they're not all ready.  OUr drill motors are the old 3/8" ones, so we were going to use the Victor 883's because we were kinda hoping that there might be another team that could lend them to us, because we can't afford them.  Also, we have and old Full Size RC, but we're using the EDU one  for most stuff (we're using the Full Size for the OI and the EDU for everything else) because it would be a waste of time for our programmer to learn P-basic for the Full Size RC.  Thanks for your help.

Allison



Don't mind me.  I need to read more carefully in the future.

Matt
2 drills for drive
1 van door for arm rotation (over the bot)
1 globe for rotating arm itself
1 globe for other special tricks
Freshmen, like all people, come in good and bad varieties.  The issue normally is that given that freshmen are younger, there is a tendency to be immature (not that all freshmen or younger are immature and not that all those who are older are mature; I've met adults who are less mature than high school students).

Immaturity can be difficult to deal with but there are ways to handle it.  Normally, these issues would mainly fall to the mentors to deal with.  One of the key things is to keep everyone busy, even if it's with fairly simple tasks.  Start with simple tasks and after they've mastered those, build the tasks into more complex ones.  This is good for everyone and has the advantage of taking those who are immature and helping them build maturity.

Now, that said, on our team, we have exactly one senior.  We have a good number of freshmen and because of the way the school is setup, we have a good number of students who would be middle school aged.  Some of our best workers are those who are freshmen or middle school students.  Frankly, I didn't know that they were that age until I asked.  So being a freshmen doesn't mean that you're going to just get in the way but it can take some more effort to make sure you don't.

Matt
lol. Why does my team disassemble half the arm to make teasers?! :rolleyes: No wonder we're not done yet!

Matt


I like the little wings on the sides. Ball corallers, no doubt. I don't see anything that could get you up the steps or onto the bar, though. I guess that's not part of your strategy?




your correct about the ball corallers...both those and the bar across the front of the robot have pvc (on the competition bot it will b poly carb) rollers on them stop the bot from riding up the balls.

as for the steps, our drive train allows us to climb the steps. the robot is kind of wieghted towards the front (the side with the battary) so that all we have to do is drive up the step until the front two sets of wheels are up on the platform and the bot will rock itself on.

and for going up the side with the six inch stair, we will used our arm to lift the front wheels up and then drive onto the platform.


if anyone has any other questions ask...my teammates and are will be more than happy to answer them.
~ej :D
Assuming we have a working robot, we'll be there (we're hoping our wheels get delivered today).

Matt
I thought that this years banner sensors are also retro reflective tape, as it turns out they are diffuse, can anyone tell me what type of surfaces or colors they can detect.


Assuming we have a working robot, we'll be there (we're hoping our wheels get delivered today).




Working or not all teams are strongly encouraged to attend. There will be lots of help to get you up to speed.

You'll also find yourself running into problems if you are using the internal timer interrupts. The easiest way around that is to add your own #ifdef  _SIMULATOR around the timer initializations to turn the interrupts off for debugging.


Yesterday, heavy winds snapped off the power pole in front of team 1043's school, plunging the school and the robotic team in darkness. More bad news - the school will be without power today -   two days lost during critical build time, just as the arm was just coming back from the machine shop.




I read that and my heart started to race, "No, isn't there somewhere someone who will let you guys work...

then read the rest. *relief and pride* Thank you for sharing that story!
we have no freshmen!!  i love it because i dont have to deal with them at all.  our team is doomed though everyone with skill is graduating.  although there is this one kreepy kid who just shows up rondomly and speeks in a soft voice.
nice site, it's neat and organized. I like the sponsor page layout
Hey,
is there a way to see if the IR / optical sensors work, i mena for the beacon you just get a camera, what is the way to c if the IR sensors are working. And whts the shipping time, if any of you have ordered new IR sensors..
wait is 255 back in the robotics compition


I thought that this years banner sensors are also retro reflective tape, as it turns out they are diffuse, can anyone tell me what type of surfaces or colors they can detect.


Pretty much anything that reflects the detector light, including the carpet if your sensitivity is adjusted too high, and retroreflective tape. The effect of the diffuse light is to restricted detection range.

From the site Dave referenced here are detectabilities of some common materials:
[http://info.bannersalesforce.com/xpedio/groups/public/documents/trainingjobaid/pr_a1_s1_e.pdf.pdf](http://info.bannersalesforce.com/xpedio/groups/public/documents/trainingjobaid/pr_a1_s1_e.pdf.pdf)
Yes, there are a few resons:
1. Lack of resources
We didn't quite have the resources we needed to put it together in time this year

2. Strategy
Reviewing the game, we determined that the multi drive would not be a sufficent advantage and it would require a major design change.

3. Pre season design/strategy
It looks like my thread from last fall was removed, so I'm going to put a link to my paper here. I put up a paper last fall on strategy, both in the design and functionality. I've gotten quite a few good comments on it.
Basically, we're sticking with what we're good at, what we know works.
Trying new things is great and all, but when and why are two important reasons. Just check out the paper...

I have to say though, that I am very pleased with our standard drive this year. The design improvements have done us justice, and it operates much smoother than last year.

Here's a link to the paper:
http://raptar.net/stuff/RobDesNut.doc


Hey,
is there a way to see if the IR / optical sensors work, i mena for the beacon you just get a camera, what is the way to c if the IR sensors are working. And whts the shipping time, if any of you have ordered new IR sensors..


There are several easy methods.

- You can just check the IR receiver buffers, see Kevin's FAQ or other posts for what to look at and how to interpret the data.

- You can disconnect the servos and printf the Tracker_Data[LEFT].Status & Tracker_Data[RIGHT].Status, i.e., the tracker states are:
NONE_IN_VIEW 0
RIGHT_IN_VIEW 1
LEFT_IN_VIEW 2
BOTH_IN_VIEW 3

- Using a regular digital input printf the value of the sensor. In the presence of the beacon or a compatable IR source like a TV remote you will see a mixture of 1's & 0's. Bad sensors show all 1's or all 0's.

For shipping you can order overnight of course. 1st class TX to NY was a couple of days (Friday to Tuesday over a holiday).
you can get a 15-day forcast here: http://wwwa.accuweather.com/adcbin/public/local_index_11to15day.asp?zipcode=08601&metric=0&partner=accuweather

if u check in like 3 days you can get the weather for when the regional is...i don't know how accurate it is though...atleast it's an idea :)


Hybrid robots?  What's the hybrid part of it? Electical and Electrical?

First of all, I do not think you will actually be able to charge your battery by any significant amount, if at all.




Neither do I...I don't think it would be an advantage at all.

Also, for a somewhat more detailed, but unofficial, explanation of the Prius hybrid system, go [here](http://home.earthlink.net/~graham1/MyToyotaPrius/Understanding/WhatsGoingOnAsIDrive.htm). The hybrid system is a bit more sophisticated than the flash animation would imply. (The general idea is the same though)

-Alex
That looks a little like ours.  We have a very small space to fit all our electronics.  Me and our electronics team were able to design a three level tower for all the electronics and robot controller.  We have maybe a cubic foot of space for the compressor, battery, tanks, etc.
Very nice.  We have omni-wheels like those.  They were made for us at the great people at Water Jet Controls.
Haha...forgot about the window motors in my vote!  And the servo!  That brings us up to 11 motors.  I'm not going to share allcoations just yet, though.
lol, this robot looks same as our, except ours can pick up more balls :D something like 10-12. Great work though.
good job to all ball collectors/catchers. ALOT of people seem to be forgetting about this portion of the game, and how many points can be scored with this! I think we (ball collectors) are gonna rock this year!
Thanks for the suggestions - the drive should be a lot smoother in a couple of days.  There are a few code improvements that we were planning to make anyways, and we will be gearing up the potentiometers to get higher accuracy at the expense of reducing the number of revolutions the gearboxes can make (currently, we are using 10-turn potentiometers 1:1, which means an accuracy of about 3 degrees or so - we are going to change that to 2:1).

For the operator controls, the plan is to have the joystick control the translational velocity and a separate knob control the angular velocity of the robot - not only does this seem to have the simplest and most direct coding implementation, it makes sense because our driver is used to driving RC cars with the steering on a separate knob.  So moving the joystick will simply move the robot without changing its orientation; turning the knob will spin the robot in place; straight ahead on the joystick and a turn of the knob will give tank-steering-like motion; sideways on the joystick and a turn of the knob will result in a "circle strafe", circling around an object while always pointing towards it.

We toyed with the idea of attempting a shifter, but that seemed a bit too ambitious - although next year, who knows?
From Bill:
Cheryl,

For people on Chief Delphi wondering about how the control panel labels are
made...

Print out the labels from a computer on plain paper.  I use PowerPoint.
Cover the top surface with clear packing tape for protection.
Cover the bottom surface with double-sided carpet tape.
Cut the labels out with scissors, peel off the carpet tape backing and stick
them down.

The integration is being done in a 100Hz ISR using timer3.




How do you get timer3 to run at 100Hz?
your only a little out of wack - two or three good wacks should fix you right up  :^)

FIRST has said this year that any spare parts you make must be shipped with the robot on the ship date  &lt;- EDIT: this part is wrong - see corrections in posts below

- you cant keep making spares at your home site after the ship date, then swap them on your bot at an event.

But you do bring up a good point - in addtion to giving the students driver practice time (which I think is ok) - having a clone-bot also allows you to debug your machine after you shipped it

and as you said, fix the bugs in the original when you get to your first event.

in that regard, yes this does seem to be against the spirit of the rules - it allows teams to do the design and build phases of the design cycle in 6 weeks, then do the test and debug phases after the ship date

so in effect, teams that can afford to clone their bot get a 9 or 10 week 'project schedule' and teams that cant have to finish everything in 6 weeks.
For anyone who has pressed the gear off and then pressed their own back on, how did you all make sure that you were doingit perfectly straight, so that you didnt put any side load on the bearing in the drill motor.  The best way I can think of would be to support the tiny little piece of the shaft that runs through the back of the drill motor, then press the new gear on.

Assuming we have a working robot, we'll be there (we're hoping our wheels get delivered today).

But Matt,

It's a Shmoebotics tradition to wire the whole robot at the scrimage!  ;)

The Scrimmage is a great place to continue working on your robot. More than one non-functioning robot turned into a working one last year. There are lots of experts around at all sorts of things, at least some of them won't be working on thier robot so they have time to help with yours.

Think of it as a regional without the pressure.

BTW the BeachBots will be there, those of us who aren't in the machine shop frantically building parts anyway.
Will the hosts of this scrimmage provide a webcast for all interested FIRST folks?


wait is 255 back in the robotics compition


... what does 255 have to do with this post ...? :confused:

Way to go team 115!!! It's great to see that there are FIRST teams like yours out there! :D

But it's a Matt tradition to frantically wire the robot the night before the scrimmage. ;)

I think we'll be done in time.  The only concern I have at the moment is getting the drive train installed and we should be doing that the next couple days (again, assuming are wheels actually arrive today).

Our issue isn't skilled people at the moment.  Our issue is just getting it done.  So we may need help with testing but I don't think we'll need it with assembly.

As a former Bay Area Team member I am not surprised.
Actually I kinda miss you guys down there.

But 115 has gone beyond GP. And again, I'm not surprised.

'bout a week to go. Have fun!
Did it come from Mars?
Does Dave Lavery know about it??
Were you planning on putting any material to those rollers so you can get more forward/backwards traction with the carpet? In my oppionion omni's are great if you can make a nice balance between traction on the carpet and still being able to slide sideways. We had thought of omni wheels before on my old team but couldn't find a simple enough way for us to power them well and gain some traction with them. We had pretty much what you posted as they are and then we decided it was just wasn't worth the added weight with little traction gain so we put teflon skids instead. (263, 2001-2003's robots)
They are none the less very nicely done. I would suggest going with some added traction device on the rollers if possible, but either way you do achieve the nice turning bonus of the omni wheel design.

In an effort not to sound stale but unable to think of a way not to... You could look at the technokats omni, or trickwheel whitepaper.  http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=226
Its a very good example of one way to add traction to the omni wheels while still being able to turn great.  Personally I have driven the ball drive robot these were on last year and they worked very nicely.

Based on information from IFI and Kevin Watson's sample code we figured out the value we needed to pre-load into the timer3 accumulator to make it overflow after 10ms. The formula (from IFI's whitepaper on timers) is:

number of ticks = (time elapsed) * 10^7/prescaler
number of ticks = (10/1000) * 10^7/8 = 12500

Since the counter overflows when it reaches 65535, you want to preload it with the difference. Therefore, the value is 65535 - 12500 = 53035. Converted to hex the value is 0xCF2B.

Using Kevin Watson's template we initialize timer3 using this code:


#define TIMER_LOW 0x2B
#define TIMER_HIGH 0xCF

void Initialize_Timer_3(void)
{
//preload the accumulator to overflow after 10ms
TMR3L = TIMER_LOW;
TMR3H = TIMER_HIGH;

//1:8 prescaler (clock=1.25MHz/each tick=800ns)
T3CONbits.T3CKPS0 = 1;
T3CONbits.T3CKPS1 = 1;

// 0: use the internal clock
T3CONbits.TMR3CS = 0;

// 1: synchronize the external clock to the PIC18F8520s internal clock, which is desirable				//
T3CONbits.T3SYNC = 1;

/* timer 3 register operations are done in one 16-bit access */
T3CONbits.RD16 = 1;

/* 1: enable timer 3 interrupt on overflow (i.e., a transition from FFFF->0) */
PIE2bits.TMR3IE = 1;

/* 0: timer 3 overflow interrupt is low priority (leave at 0 on IFI controllers) */
IPR2bits.TMR3IP = 0;

/* timer 3 is enabled */
T3CONbits.TMR3ON = 1;
}



Don't forget to preload the accumulator for the timer again during the ISR. At the top of the function we just copied the first two lines of the initialization:



void Timer_3_Int_Handler(void)
{
/*reload the timer offset*/
TMR3L = TIMER_LOW;
TMR3H = TIMER_HIGH;
etc.



Since we need to do analog conversion during the ISR we made sure to disable the global interrupts in the main program before using the ADC. Setting INTCONbits.GIEL = 0 disables the low priority interrupts, then setting it back to 1 enables them.
To get a .0002-.0005 press fit, you have to measure the actual shaft diameters as they vary from motor to motor. The actuals on the motors we had were somewhere around the .197 (inch) diameter but varied within .0005. We also found that two of our motors had slightly damaged shafts from where the pinion was pressed improperly.  We then had a local machine shop make the parts. Two machining methods will work quite well; jig grinding or honing. A reamer is not as consistent as you would think.

To press a new gear on, you would need to support the shaft at the back of the rotor and then press axially so that no force is directed into the stationary portions of the motor. A good arbor press is valuable. A higher quality vise would also work (where the jaws maintain a decent parallelism under load). Always have at least a second set of hands helping while doing this unless you develop some ingenious tooling. Red Loctite is also a good idea (not in lieu of the press fit but to augment it), but as most people will warn you about Loctite, cleanliness of the surfaces prior to applying the Loctite is critical.

Good Luck
I think you BOTH are wacked ;-)

As far as I know, the rules say you can bring spare PARTS (not assemblies) with you to the competition as long as they were made during the 6 weeks.

Am I wrong?

2 drill (drive train)
2 window (arm)
1 globe (plow arms)

hopefully another globe for 2x ball if we have time
With all this controversy looming around the FIRST community this is a truely great story. Way to go 115

FIRST rocks, thats for sure.
I think there's really 2 debates going on here, one with the battlebots show, and one with the competition.
As for the show, and how it's presented, I totally agree that it has some major issues. Did you know that they are shifting networks? They claim that the show will have a new feel. Perhaps we as FIRST youth should send in a petition of sorts of our opinions of how things should be presented. Takers?
As for the competition, I can tell you, it is more than you would think. GP is present in the works, and there is more to each bot than meets the eye. Creativity is just as apparent as it is in FIRST.
And yes, there really is a game, it's not just "Search and Destroy"
So, I still think the competition itself is pretty good, it could get touched up a bit, and the way it's presented needs a facelift. But overall, it is a uniqe competition that inspires the mind just as FIRST does.
We had a student videographer at last year's Phoenix competition. Can you believe we only NOW got a copy of his high school project. It's about our team, but it has some views of other things at the competition and you may want to take a look.

Ok thanks for all of the comments.  To answer the first question about the wheels.  We are able to turn just fine since we shaved the treads off.  It turns all day long.  As for the wheels under the yellow stuff.  Those are going to be fixed casters that serve almost as a wheelie bar. They prevent us from falling over if we get pushed while trying to get up the 6" step.  1108 I'm looking forward to seeing your robot and I guess we'll see you in houston.
Here is a link to team update 10 that states that the ship date has been in fact changed to Thursday February 26th.

Hope this clears it all up...

This is a rule that I do not agree with. You have 6 weeks to build a robot, period. Designing and writing software is no different than building a part. You can't build spare parts so why should you be able to write spare code?  They provide a test platform so its not as if no work can be done before the robot is completed. It is a design challenge to build software that can cleanly scale from the EDU controller to the full-size controller. I do not think teams need a great autonomous program to be successful. The game this year will not be won or lost in the first 15 seconds, but that 15 seconds provides a much more interesting design challenge to the software people. There seems to be a slant towards the mechanical side of robotics in FIRST and this is step towards validating the software side. I think they need to keep the autonomous period intact but level the playing field.
I dont know if I agree with your assesment of auton mode. if you dont get the release ball in auton, then your sides scoring object dont fall until T=45

thats 30 seconds of playtime with nothing on the floor to herd - I think that will be a big factor

also, if your auton is really good, you can not only get the release ball, but maybe snarf a 2X ball, or start sweeping up the small ones that have dropped.

I think auton mode will be a deciding factor this year.
After our team fiasco of trying to build 2 robots our first year of FIRST (1996), I swore an oath* that I would never try that again.

I spent the next 6 years telling any rookies that would listen that they should spend the time finishing ONE robot faster in order to get drive time for their students.

Last year, autonomous mode changed my mind. I maintain that it is 10 to 100 times more likely that you will have a competitive autonomous mode if you build a second robot. Given that autonomous mode was huge last year (and figures to be huge this year imho), building 2 robots with lower capability is more likely to help your team than having 1 supercapable robot with a so-so autonomous mode.

So... ...I now tell every rookie team that will listen that they should plan on building 2 robots.

A wise man's mind changes and a fool's mind changes not...

Joe J.



*For those who take oaths seriously, myself included, please note that in this context, I use the term for effect, I did NOT actually swear an oath that I am now breaking.
Geez, we just jump from one controversy to the next, don't we? ;)

Honestly, this has been going on for years. And even though it looks unfair from the outside, just because they may have a couple of extra weeks to tweak with a second one, doesn't mean they're unbeatable in competition. If they were unbeatable, the retention rate would have dropped off long ago, because smaller teams would see a lost cause.
You also have to think about natural driver skill. You may be only able to build one robot, but that kid painting the crate in the corner just may be a star driver in disguise.

So give it your all, the David beats the Goliath more than you think. ;)

Hey Matt (and others),

I will be in town this weekend visitng friends at UCLA.  I think I am going to drop by at the scrimmage to see the robots.  Even if you don't have a robot to bring to this scrimmage, you can still drop by for a chat ;-).
It depends how you set it up in the event manager as to how well it would work, but i bet if you do it right it would work within the GUI, but scripting seems easier then taking the time and testing them out.  Good job with the script, did you do it through tutorial??? or was it all purely thought up with a bit of inspiration????

This is the first year that we are building two robots as a team. Both are fairly close to each other in construction, with the main focus being put on the competition bot. The primary function that the "clone" bot will serve is the one of driver training and autonomous programming, it is an advantage, and I'm glad we decided to do it.
G-Code is one of my favorite programming languages!  I learned it from a manual that came with the CNC machine that I used, but I found the following web site which looks like a good overview:

http://www.linuxcnc.org/handbook/gcode/g-code.html

Good luck!  By the way, it is rather uncommon to write G-Code by hand.  Lots of CAD programs are available with manufacturing packages as well, and these manufacturing packages can generate G-Code for your CAD drawing automatically.  You simply have to tell it which surfaces you want to machine with what tools, how your stock is mounted, specify some parameters (such as feedrates, spindle speeds, and tool properties), and it will generate the G-Code automatically for you.  In any case, it is still pretty important to know the main G-Code commands if you are going to operate a CNC machine.

And here is some of the G-Code used to machine an omni-wheel.  This is G-Code that I generated automatically from I-DEAS:  :)

Can you guess which part of the omniwheel this is for???  ;)  Interestingly, CNC machines used to read programs off of a roll of tape (holes were punched out in rows and columns to encode the commands).  The above program, if I had pasted the whole thing, would require a roll of tape over one mile long in distance!!


We aren't using infra-red until we are within feet of the beacon.




Well, technically you already are.  :)

But anyway, 384 is doing are trust dead-recog. I was thinking of doing a fail-safe type system, where the robot would line-follow, then if it looses the line, instead of just stopping, goes into infra-red detection mode, then in dead-recon.
something our team did this year that really helped out with auton mode is we built a pratice robot before the kickoff meeting, using the 2x4 alum frames and 3/8 plywood base, and the stock FIRST transmissions and drill motors from last year (with old RCs from previous machines)

this allowed our students to build something that ran around on the floor before the kickoff, so they got some confidence in their abilities

and it lets students pratice driving something

and it let us mount a gyro sensor and contact switches and play with the IR sensors in the first few weeks of the program - so we had the basis of our auton mode working on our practice bot (named Frank BTW)

switching it over to the real machine is not hard now, we do have to translate from Pbasic to C - but we are confident that our approach is solid and wont take too much tweaking on KG1 (our real bot for this year: KateGleasonOne)

I keep threating to post photos of Frank on here - I will get to it - maybe tonight (I dont have a digital camera, it 'dissapeared' when my daughter went off to college - I wonder where it could be?!)
please search before posting a post looking for teams.  you can go [here](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/memberlist.php?do=search) to do an advanced search for members on specific teams.

amazing omni wheels, just a few questions, what are the larger (white) disks made of and how are the (clear) disks that look like polycarbonate held in?
This is also the first year 151 is trying to build two robots.

-Gives drivers loads of pratice
-Gives Software loads of time to get the code just right

These robots are going to be exactly the same. We have expermented with a second plywood bot for testing but we have found that after the drivers use the pratice bot for a while and then switch to the real robot, there feel for it is off. This is something we did not want to happen again, hence two "real" robots.

No tutorial.  Just the reference file and the index.
Here it is. Basically finished and in full competition condition(the picture is from about 3 hours before it was completely finished). The robot works like a charm. We've got pvc wings on pneumatics on the outside, at the great 6 inch height. We have the kit wheels on right now which allow us to drive up the side and manuever around the raised areas easily. We have a second set with our own special rubber to be put on. The drivetrain has two speeds controlled by a servo on the bosch gearbox, light simple and it works as long as you're not moving. We've got an arm, the bottom joint has two positions controlled by a pneumatic and the top joint has full rotational ability. The ball grabber has large 20 inch hoops which completely encompas the ball and lock it in. We can place the ball on the tall and short goals. We've got a goal grabber on the back of the robot. Its a drive on mechanism. We can just drive back onto a goal to grab it. To release it we have a pneumatic. The tube along the arm is our extender. The one in the picture isn't completely up to date, but it extends to well over 10 feet and is guided by the arm so we can grab from many locations and do it easily. So that about covers it, we do everything except grab the 10 point ball or store little balls. I'll get some pictures of it in action up today. Plus you can see more at http://stuypulse.com

Agreed. Manga/comics are good to look at once in a while, but I really would like nice-hard core words more than once a page...
nice looking robot, i just have a question, have you had any problems with that long chain snagging or dismounting the sprocket while you are manipulating your arm?
2 drills -drive
2 window - ball plow
1 fp - lift winch
1 fp robot winch
1 seat - big ball holder
1/2 (we arent sure yet....) servo - shifter
1 servo - mobile goal hook

no pneumatics

thats  a total of 9
If I'm not mistaken, our robot's software thinks there are ten motors, one compressor, and four pneumatic actuators. One of the actuators isn't included on the actual robot, but the software doesn't care.

Ten motors. :ahh:   And I thought we were designing something *simple* this year.
Correct on both parts.
